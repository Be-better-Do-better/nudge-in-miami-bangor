where
to to um
with his mom with his he lives with his mom or with his sister
he no with his mom
he's moving with his they 're moving from from the house there right
and right now
it's like almost fifty dollars cheaper in rent
but they sold their house verdad
they sold their house
ok
like he doesn't like even water
and he he lives there with his
he lives there with his wife and his daughter
yeah
but nothing
it's his wife and everybody
not just
yeah you know
and she's retired the
her gran she she's responsible for the you know her mom
and her her older daughter
yeah
so fernando's like fed up with it
well the thing is that they started looking for a new house to move in
just fernando and his mom
uhhuh and his nieces
and the grandmother
if she wants to go with them
because she was taking
but the sister but the sister the one that was married and lives somewhere else right
yeah she lives somewhere else
ok
but the grandmother was taking you know her son's side
but the thing is that yeah i don't know yeah
it's so annoying
it's a little machista
yeah
she tell me like they favour them so much
yeah i don't know if it's like this hispanic thing that the men are
how annoying
yeah
no matter what the
with my mom and my uncle you know my mom says that she's like you know she's always favoured my uncle
my grandma was the same way with my brother
like even to this day even to this day she'll' give like you know money for to pay the rent y todo
like if when because he goes to work
so he'll' call in sick
so to make up the difference my grandmother will give it to him
that's low
it's not it's it's it's in general
i don't agree that's all yeah
i think it's like all
i mean i understand helping a child helping your kid if they 're in you know they 're in a crisis situation
yeah but
wow well the thing is that they found this place right
but the house comes with a little efficiency
outside
oh ok
within the the
you know within the area
and so fernando's like well just tell my uncle that he wants to go live with us that the he can rent the apartment out
rent rent ok
don't don't yeah don't let him know that the that it comes with the house
so they 're they 're like well if you wan+ na move in next to us it's cheap it's fifty dollars and you 're not gon+ na get cheaper than that anywhere
mmhm
so he's gon+ na pay for the fifty dollars his water his light
he thinks that he he's that he's just helping out
yeah
don't wan+ na know
it's kind of it's you know but that was the only way to make him you know
but why do they have to live with him
why can't he live with his wife and kids in another place
because apparently he he can't afford living on his own
the grandmother wants the
a lot of um yeah
and his wife works tambien
yes
and somehow fernando's
how many kids do they have
one kid
one little girl
and they can't afford rent or anything
not even
and fernando's mom retired
and fernando are sustaining all of them
i mean that's like ridiculous
that's crazy

fernando joined it
he's been telling me to join
i told michael i'm' like i think i'm' gon+ na do it
well you pay nine dollars for the first three months

no my parents i think my parents don't have it any more
i think sarah does

just that
yes please thank you
um what was i saying
so i i called her in
the passport
and she calls me back
and she's like chloe we 're having a meeting all the designers i need to clear things up
and i'm' like
raquel's the name of the boss
yeah
yeah
ok
our supervisor is ana
and honestly
ana's her cousin
no ana's just a girl she's always worked with
but
but she's not above her
no she's below her
she's just above us
ok
to me she's always been nice but she's
who ana
yeah
oh ok
oh really
well then the thing is raquel wanted to confront everybody
and clear everything out
and and tell ana that that wasn't TRUE
she had me on phone conference
and she practically told ana that no that everything that she said she was telling her and it wasn't right she wasn't referring to us
whatever
and i the thing is that i get to the office and ana's like almost crying
yeah
she's like but she's like believe me that's what she says i'm' not lying
so i don't know who's lying you know
and so they both have a reputation of
yeah both of them
so it's like lauren i don't know who to trust
some people are good actors too
oh yeah
and oh and then raquel she blamed it on elisa
elisa left the office
she she got transferred to new york
so you know she she kind of found ok well let me blame it on elisa because she's not in the office
but if this
to defend herself
but in the end if this if this problem gets bigger and ana says well elisa was the one gossiping you know
uhhuh
and she does elisa's like she doesn't know what's going on
it's a mess
and i'm' just like tired of it
what was it what was it they were blaming on were blaming on her
that she she was the one that told raquel that what ana was saying to us
that's how raquel found out that you know ana was telling telling us that she wasn't she wasn't happy with our work
oh
yeah
well well if she's not happy with the work fine you know
she could i mean you can understand that you know
everybody has their own level of expectations
but
but why don't you think just sit down and be like look you guys i would prefer if you guys
and she's telling us she never said that
and honestly i'm' tired of it
and i don't care you know
no thank you
thank you
yes
you know in situations like that the truth always comes out
always
sooner or later somebody will slip
mmhm
how annoying
that's like is like high school
yeah
mmm
but they 're not complaining about you are they
i get along with everybody
mmhm
but i just hate being
yeah all the second guessing back and forth thing
and it's distracting
yeah
they gave me two tickets to the movies
oh really
for my birthday
who at work
that's cool
for my birthday
hmm
oh it's michael
ah
hello
hi
thank you
i'm' here at denny's with my cousin
because we 're eating breakfast
or lunch
you don't seem to
i told you i told you yesterday i was gon+ na go and do this remember
i was gon+ na do the whole um recording thing for maria's friend
yes
oh
very cute
i told you i was gon+ na eat at denny's with chloe
but that's it i'm' not
no no more sweets
that that's the end of it i promise
no sweets today no sweets
tomorrow i promise
i got+ ta talk to you about my puppy
she has her her lungs are swollen
and they put her on antibiotics for two weeks
two pills a day
and i have to give her fifteen drops of some fluid thing
he doesn't he
i told him what happened
he he started making a noise
i'm' like yes that is exactly it
and so then he did an x-ray out of her lungs
and he asked me he's like has she been in has she been in an accident or something
i'm' like no
he's like has she you know gone into the pool
i guess asking me if she's swallowed water or something
i'm' like no i'm' like she hates the water
i mean god even when i bathe her you know it's like no
so i don't know if maybe it's from before that she's had it
and she's accumulating sitting there
i mean i don't know
one day maybe one day when i took her to the beach
she might have swallowed some water accidentally
i mean i don't know where it came from
so he told me to
huh
no no no no i'm' like it's curable it's treatable
he's like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
he's like it's just that her
he he showed me the x-ray
it's like a part of her lung
it's so fascinating
like i would i would wan+ na be a vet except i don't like biology
oh and they had to put a little cat to sleep today
i'll' tell you about that later
this is so sad
oy
uhuh this is why i couldn't be a vet
anyways um
no he showed me a part of her lungs that that in the x-ray they came out black
like they were just very dark because they were swollen
and he's like you see it's like they shouldn't be that dark they should be more like this
and he compared it to a like a lighter gray area in her lung
so he's like well we'll' put her on antibiotics
and then come back in two weeks
so
he's like well he's like he's not sure he's like he's like you know put try take the biotics because her lungs are swollen
i i guess her lungs are swollen and making her cough
and so then
what her lungs being swollen
i don't know
i didn't ask him
he's not sure what it is
he told me to to give her the medication
and then see if it happens in two weeks
and then if it continues in two weeks then he'll' he'll' see what else it you know what else it could be
so
he gave her a shot today so i'm' not gon+ na give her any medication until tomorrow
so she's in my room right now
she's sleeping because she's drowsy and stuff
and he cleaned her glands
and then i told him about the about the flea thing
he gave me some pills for the fleas
um it's a pill
you give her one pill every ten days and it kills the fleas within thirty um thirty minutes of her taking the pills
so i gave her the pill right when i got home
and he just told me just to you know not to bathe her now
but um to you know just clean the house or whatever like you know
the usual
he he told me you 've got nothing to worry about obviously
so other than that she's ok
i i don't know
i didn't ask him i didn't ask him
um he knew he knew what it was
he knew what medication to give her
so i'm' sure he must be familiar with what whatever it is
he's just asked me where it came from
and i told him i didn't know so
because i didn't know i guess he couldn't really
he couldn't assume where it came from so
the coughing
yeah he's like it's probably because her lungs are swollen
he told me
so he's like
i didn't tell him about the sneezing
the sneezing i really think is because she hits her nose
i mean when i hit my nose i sneeze
so uh she's always launching herself into the carpet
and hitting herself with a paw
and i just think it has to do with that
but i'll' mention it
if it continues like severely then i i'll' tell him in two weeks when i see him
he took her temperature
she has um she had a hundred and two of um temperature
her normal temperature is is one oh one
so it was a little bit high
so
but he said it wasn't a fever or anything
and she gained like two pounds
so
ok what are we gon+ na do
um four maybe
ok
ok bye
what are you gon+ na do afterwards
i dunno
i have to well i need to i have to finish a a drawing for my parents
and so yesterday michael and i
he started telling me like
he sketched over what i need to put in the drawings
so but i need him to help me draw detail
because the wall's being constructed
uhhuh
like i know like the foundations and the footings
but i don't know the actual construction
and what what the materials are called
and how to technically put them in the drawings
so he does obviously
mmhm
so i have to sit with him and do it
my parents are like asking me and bothering me about it
i'm' like
i understand
but it's like look like i have things to do
you know last weekend like i had to take work home for my boss
yeah
my boss
so it's like i i don't don't assume that i have every weekend all the time to do it you know
then i have that exam to study for
so ugh
i wanted to go to um
what are you doing what are we gon+ na do afterwards
nothing i have
i wanted to go to old navy
well i have to go to old navy to get um carolina and carolina's daughter something for tomorrow so
mmhm
i figure i'll' find something there in the sale
because i just spent a hundred and forty dollars on the vet
so i have no money
uhhuh
later i have to go with sarah to to buy something for somebody's one of our friend's birthdays that's tonight
and
you 're gon+ na a party
yeah it's in one it's in a house
like a get together
um and i have work to do
for work
because yesterday oh with the whole passport thing uhhuh i had to do uh the ladies like in the morning
she told me she's like you have to do this today
alright
so i'm' like oh i told the my coworkers and raquel
i'm' like i i'm' not feeling well i have to go home whatever
so i'm' like i'll' take work home
i didn't tell them that
yeah
so on monday i won't be behind
do they pay you more for taking work home or no
no
and i don't tell them what i do
because
yeah
yeah
um
and they'll' expect me to do it every weekend or something
yeah
and i think she's like she's kinda noticing that all of us are just fed up with the whole situation
who the raquel the lady raquel
mmhm
and that we 're just we 're sick of it
there's so much drama
you don't need much contact with all this stress and deadlines
we don't need it
you don't need additional stress
no
i mean the job's stressful enough
we don't i don't need to add to it
and that's what she does
so i get really we fell down on like review like two weeks ago
i guess she's asking for our bonuses
they don't do that thing where you can review her
i think we do
i don't know when they 're gon+ na you know cuando nos yeah
it could be anonymous
no and it's not anonymous
well she's a bitch
and she's bipolar
did the guy leave that guy that she was
no he's still there
i thought he was leaving to new york you said or something
he they haven't mentioned it again
i don't know
sometimes i think that it would be best
but sometimes i think it wouldn't
because when he's around she's like you know
in a better mood
she doesn't yeah she doesn't bother us
she's not like on our back every five minutes is it done yet is it done yet
that's annoying
it's in there's a when they thank god it wasn't me
we went we we had our morning meeting whatever
we went to the office mari
and maricarmen had to do you know
she had an assignment that day
and she calls
they don't know what it's like to do the work
that's why they ask so much and they
like it happens to me sometimes at work it's like
you know they give me something
they don't even
sometimes they don't understand that it's a lot of coordinating and a lot of you know flipping back and forth
and they 're like oh can you have it by tomorrow
and i'm' like no
you know i can try
but i'm' not i gon+ na lie to you and tell you that it's possible
mmhm
because well there's just me alone
and it's because they either they maybe once did it
or now they forgot you know that it takes so long how time consuming it is
or it turns out they 've never done it so
leticia told her one day one day you should just sit with one of us and you know sit down and actually take your time and see how long it takes to draw something
that's the only problem with my boss
she's
the people that actually those the parties that i work with the school parties my team they 're really good
mmhm
because like i had to do something for like the bathrooms right
mmhm
and i had to select tiles
and yes it sounds very easy
but it's a lot of time consuming
because
yeah
it's very time consuming because they give you a board with different price ranges
there's group one two three and four and five
five being the most expensive
mmhm
and then in in the specs like which which is part of your contract you tell them you know price group one and two are the cheapest you 're gon+ na use maybe fifty five percent thirty five percent of that and then the most expensive one group four you use five percent
so i have to make sure that what i'm' using has been assigned to the bathroom in that percentage
you know how long
i mean it takes a lot
and then in addition to that i have to coordinate that with flooring and you know the other interior finishes
yeah
i mean there's a lot of work
and i started sketching and this and that
so when i told my boss i'm' like i'm' sorry look i know it's taking a long time it's like i'm' just you know lollygagging
but she said no no
she's like i'm' not you know i'm' not questioning your you know just whatever
but i wan+ na get them right once
because when thank god when we submitted the drawings we didn't ask like the tile yet
mmhm
what we gave them in the spec what we were gon+ na price out in the contractor didn't didn't bid it out didn't price it
so the so now when we 're submitting these new drawings the drawing the the work is coming out more expensive now
but it wasn't our fault
it was that he he no he didn't bid it correctly
mmhm
so he comes he comes to the the contractor comes to us and he's like oh you know you guys use this and that
and i'm' like no
and i stopped him right then and there and i printed out all the drawings and i'm' like i know what i did i worked on this for a month and a half you know i know i i mean i memorized the color line and the numbers and everything i it's you know
yeah
and at the end we were right
so i'm' like i'm' glad that i took so much time to do that
because now at the end it avoids error
do they expect us
i mean no i mean we pulled it off i don't know how
did you think like projects en un dia
lauren
and then
but i told her i'm' like
yeah we 're we 're like a little sweatshop
the other day the a_c was messed up
it's messed up
and i dunno when they 're gon+ na fix it
are your in your building
in my in our room in our office
all right
and we had that
and we 're like are i'm' sure this is like como unos chinitos ahi trabajan
it's crazy
we were watching something about that
on dateline last friday
um
you don't watch that
about china
no taiwan
nike for an eighty five dollar pair of shoes that they have they pay one factory twenty dollars
uhhuh
yeah
one factory
and within that they divide it within the employees
the most an employee who works there makes there is two dollars
yeah
i was like how much
o_b i met when i went to was it no it was in china
uh we went to this place where they give massages and stuff
uhhuh
and one of the guys told us that a week they make five dollars
we used to
do you remember my dad's neighbors
you remember my dad's neighbors my dad my dad's old neighborhood
the people that lived
there was a some puerto rican couple couple that lived here
uhhuh
you don't remember them
they were from taiwan
the father did that
he did it the tennis he was in the tennis shoes business
mmhm
and he used to come in with the with all these shoes
and he used to be like look this is nike
uhhuh
and he used to wear them
and it's the same thing in my eyes
yeah
uhhuh
it's like it's the same thing
no
you know the nike check on it
you know what i did learn
um
they well other than i guess they have tests and stuff
mmhm
they bang it against you know the floor or a surface
a surface uhhuh
uhhuh
and we were testing some things that we had bought from chico's
it was like forty five dollar you know um bracelets and stuff like that
and all of them had lead
had lead
how can you tell the difference
like you compare two sounds
or you you automatically know
yeah
like get get a get one of your rings or something that's like gold or something or stainless steel
like like costume jewelry
something like that and just go like that
mmhm
and get something you 've bought
and you you know something you wan+ na see if it has lead
and it usually has like a heavier um pounding sound
and the other sound is very light

oh now that i now that i remember antes de que se me olvide
this lady from the school
mmhm
she told me she told me that she bought the subway passes for the whole year
subway passes to where to new york
to new york it's forty bucks
yeah but you know what she bought i told you she bought that pass
it's a special pass that they give
which one
um
it's a special pass
it's called something and it gives you also discounts to certain museums in new york
it's like a
but for the whole year
but it comes out more expensive doesn't it
i don't know she says she can use it up and down as many times as she wants
like i would
was she gon+ na give it to you
i wonder if it has a picture
i should ask her
i don't know
i don't know because i saw that
they talk about it
it's called something
it's like a a supersaver i don't know what
and i was like why do they keep on referencing this
but she just told me as in subway only
i wonder what it is
yes for the subway
it's for the it's it's for that
but there may be something different that she bought
because this one serves as as a as a thing for the subway
but it also gives you if you have that card sometimes you can get into certain museums and things like that
she told me she paid forty two dollars or forty dollars or something like that
it's like using the metro here and you buy the annual pass it comes out cheaper
that was katherine hart by the way

i 've seen it in a in a in a
maybe like i bumped into it going home since it's on my way

go down a minute
because you have to
countdowns
oh it starts all the way there then
you you took it away right
the countdown no
where is it
it's in the page
just stick it under i where i like to meet

go up go up
yeah that's your
from object all the way to countdown new york new york

yeah
yes
so these are all the new ones
i'm' gon+ na check the the before i send anything out i'm'

yeah so
did you guys make up already
so that's that
did you guys make up
where it's coming from
a sharpener

you have to go
you have to go
ah ok
yeah

no this is this is a black one
oh ok
yeah
oh ok
ok mama
ok ok
you did it
cool
yeah
ok ok that's fine
ok bye bye
alright so what are we doing now
ok
so what else
i already figured it out
i'm' just gon+ na go through this
make sure we have everything
make the copies
separate the the finance agreements
ok
and then you know put them back there
ok
and then i asked her
mmhm
mmhm
there's a little more stuff down there
yes
all this yeah
this was all here
so it's that new stuff
is it old stuff
what is it
this is pretty new stuff this is pretty new things that i have opened up
ok
ok
because i wasn't sure
but i have to figure out what it is
yeah
and then this thing this nightmare that just doesn't go away
mmhm
yeah here's the thing
mmhm
oh wait this is mine
this says x
right
ok it does it's not giving me a base flood zone
but it wants it
mm
so then
exactly
and then also the lender's requesting flood insurance even though property is in x zone
mmhm
mmhm
right
why
and then
like he's doing it like a precaution
exactly
and then what's the value
what's the charge on it right
we need the appraisal no
what's the amount
yeah
we don't know
we don't
i mean
exactly
because that was from
i don't know if that's still in the computer
i doubt very much
yeah
if if you do a quote without those numbers and only that building would it come up too at one eighty eight or
mmhm
oh
that's the only thing
and we can do that or
yeah yeah
we can do that ourselves so we don't need that
when when you go in on basic standard it says standard quotes
i think this one it says preferred something or the other
yeah
yeah yeah
it's down here

*herring14.csv*
yeah
so he said he was getting like medium haircut
i know it because he's used to his long hair and stuff
yeah
i don't know
let's see hmm
but are you remembering all this stuff
it is like a lot of characters and data
memorization
but it's a lot
i hate maths too so
i wouldn't be good at chinese
i 'd be better at hebrew
yeah
it is like
no
don't don't act like you know chinese
um
ah i'm' president
for what
mm
yeah
most students don't care about like voting and stuff
but lately they 've been like out there pushing it hard
like a million people wan+ na give you a flyer and food
yeah because i think most of those people are because they don't live here so is like i 've just come here to study that's it i don't i don't mind
yeah
i was eating in subway and then
subway with the cup
yeah
um i was eating food and the girl in front of me was saying like oh i was at the library those people were bothering me and telling me but i don't care about that i really don't care about this place
so like she is kind of like shows the typical attitude of like
yeah
people not want it to go
but in my case probably if i would live here i would care because they can deal with issues and stuff
yeah
i think most students would be more involved if they had more time
but they have a full schedule
they have they may have a job
and then they have to study
so they 're like i don't that's wasting my time
they don't stop to like find out about who's president cause they 're too busy
and i understand them cause that happens to me
but i don't know but i don't know if those are like doing campaign and getting people to know their their ideas
yeah yeah
they are
some times also
but only through flyers like they just show you their flyers and talk to
they 're not doing like a whole campaign like an official campaign
exactly
you don't really know why you 're voting for
yeah
who's that people i just saw
people don't like to read
but it's kind of funny
it's interesting
people don't like to read
yeah
who is like looks the nicest like oh
yeah
like oh this is a good looking guy oh
oh that one is some nerd
i don't wan+ na vote for him
yeah
something like that
or like this person gave me cupcakes
i'll' vote for her
but look
but i think it's funny because it represents like how the nation is
like people don't sit down and
listen to our campaign
they just look at the flyers and like oh i 've i wan+ na vote for a man or i wan+ na vote for a woman or a black man like green alec
oh a black man as a president would be awesome
but they 're going by the image or like a woman as a president
but like it's a big issue anyway
like that oh my goodness
eh
but i don't know
i would have to live in here
i wan+ na live in here
on campus
cafeteria exactly dry cleaning

ah
i don't know

yeah i would love to do it
you get the
but there's the thing like i i'm' really like i wan+ na be involved in the church and stuff
and like i feel like i wouldn't be able to leave because of that
but i guess i just pray about it
the lord knows
but that peace corps is what is only for people chinese or what
no it's every country
but what do they do there
like
whatever the country needs
like helping kids
taking care of hungers
um building

no we don't need help
probably they think that the president says
oh it's ok
yeah exactly
thirty seven percent it's a lot of people
the caribbean is like not much and here and in latin america are the top ones
but i would go oh my god guatemala
yeah
i would go there just for the thing
it's cool
i went to guatemala
just for gon+ na to machu picchu and all stuff
yeah
machu picchu is in guatemala right
the ruins
i don't know
i don't know either
i went to guatemala as a city

that was really cool
oh my goodness
macedonia

it's really nice been in another country
yeah
you know where i'm' gon+ na go

yeah
travel the world
i know all of that because in my history class we 're estamos viendo todo eso
the roman empire
cool
all around the world
what
kazakhstan
kazakhstan
yeah
borat was from there
but it is so big that country
here fifty four
fifty five
no
ah fifty four
look
it's huge
yeah
my mom didn't even know it existed
she's like ah
it's bigger than colombia
my mom started laughing like aha kazakhstan he made that up
and i'm' like no no exist
talk like that
kurdish republic
morocco
ay morocco is cool
it's just here
next to
morocco
you can go to spain
or those countries also
you couldn't travel because if you 're helping people there you 're can just doing that
what do you mean
because if for example i mean in in the case you 're gon+ na morocco si estas ahi tu no puedes decir no me voy a pasar para espana
i mean
you wouldn't need to go to spain
country ah
i don't think you could because you 're volunteer in there
i think you are twenty four seven
oh but they give you
yeah but they probably give you a day off two days off
yeah but just going for one day
what happens if you 're working here
and spain is over there
it's like being in in boston
and you want just go to mexico
and you have only one day off
that's not possible
i guess so
i don't know
but i wan+ na go where is mozambique
mozambique
mozambique
mozambique
thirty six right there
this is madagascar
i know where's madagascar
ah
japan
no philippines
philippines

it's an island that it's just next to china
are you crazy
no
over here
that's japan
and what is this
thailand
like part of malaysia
yeah
philippines
malaysia
japan
rome i wan+ na go rome ok
experience
to teach english in another country it's super fun
well you got+ ta know the language of the other
yeah yeah i spoke to the lady who give me the brochure
and she said that they teach you english for two years
i mean not english
they teach you the the country the language of the country you 're gon+ na for two years and the
wow but this program is long
yeah it's twenty seven months you have to volunteer
twenty seven months
that's more than two years
yeah
no
i won't do that
yeah
it's only volunteer
well they pay for everything
yeah
but it's like you don't have you don't get a saving
but
it's like
for example if you your career is doing that it's good
but my case wouldn't be
because this this helps you to develop a curriculum
it's not about developing curriculum either
oh my goodness
are you sure it's a cow
or a horse
it's look like a cow
it is a no it is a cow
even the cow is starving dude
that's horrible
interesting
is a volunteer in mongolia
it's super cool
but it's an experience of a lifetime
let me see
oh my god
even if you don't go with peace corps it's like if you go on mission work
that's so awesome
i love it
you get to meet so much so many people
but uh
ah
what was that
ah
whatever
it's just talking
oh look
a butterfly
oh my god
it's huge
ah
like the approach you have for everything
and that would be like bothersome because
but it's good also because
ah i don't know
the building would have to be thinner
but what's good about this it's because is this deep it allows the air go beneath the the building so so that's why this is so fresh
they did it in that way because this is always like that
yeah
it's like pressure
slippery
ah
ah
that would mean more
would it be people friendly
like
i like furniture and buildings and i like people friendly not
somebody else
you design it for somebody else
oh my goodness
jane
jane
oh no
oh
anyway
oh my goodness
it's like
why
standard
ah
you know what i mean
i know
arguing

*herring15.csv*
so you don't even look at a computer
like he just like he does it
but he just does as far as he gets you know what i mean
yeah
and like he'll' have time to do like maybe
like we have to turn in a project for
like every couple three weeks you turn in a project
and then we have to do like one two or three tutorials
and when he does the tutorials like he'll' get through like one in each class
but he won't like he won't go over all the material
the projects take like four hours to do so mmm
so he doesn't go over all the material
and the only time that we like actually have in-class time with the computer like the teacher like can help you is on thursdays
uhuh
and it's only from twelve thirty to one forty five
no
and he looks he looks he looks really like strict man
yeah bro
when i i still have my hard
he still has my hard drive
i still haven't gone to get it
flash drive
been there for like a year
yeah
yeah bro
i 've lost two already because i give them
i turn them in
and like the next week i forget to get them back
and then like the week after that he doesn't know where the hell they are
for real
yeah
usually he knows usually he knows where it is
but
but he's like oh yeah
but because i don't know
he said there was something wrong with him
um
watch that girl that walks like a robot
oh that's the girl from the gym right
yeah she lives in the everglades
but um
he doesn't
he says he's got a heart problem or something now
and so he doesn't check the work
like he actually has a person that helps him in another class check all the work for him
but when i asked him he's like yeah yeah i have here that you did it but i don't know like i don't know what to tell you about your flash drive
so i brought through two other
i figured another one
because i did the same thing the last time we turned all our projects in
so he's losing the harddrive the the flashdrive
i don't know if it's him
it might be the other lady there
but um that's his fault man
because we have a lady
but whatever bro
as long as he gets the the grades in in and stuff
i don't care
yeah that class the that anatomy class something is pretty hard man
um that's what i thought
take the nights bro
you have to take anatomy
oh i thought you said the advanced class of that
you have to take the advanced class of that
yeah
doesn't dan know everything about that
i'm' sure he does
i'm' gon+ na ask him
he had to have taken it right
yeah he did take that class
computer but mine was computer application for business
and then i have advanced computer application
what's your major again
international business and marketing
oh yeah
double major
damn
yeah bro
now i told you how i found a lot of everything about that car bro
what
that it's two grand over the cost of of that car to get it fixed
oh yeah yeah a lot of
for for like for like a two thousand one honda civic like with leather
and like i mean it's got a lot of extras and stuff
it's like seventy one hundred
and it the the estimate came back at ninety two hundred bro
how many miles did it have on it though
like fifty
fifty
yeah
fifty what thousand
yeah
and what year was it
two thousand one
damn man
why such little mileage
huh
why such a little mileage
because she bro it was her car from like when she was in high school
she bought that car when she was a sophomore
and then like she went to college or whatever
and and like didn't drive
she she went to u_s_f
so at that campus it's not like miami like you know what i mean
yeah
you go over there you just hang out there fraternity houses sorority houses or whatever
like go to city every once in a while
and she didn't come home
she came home like bro twice a semester
so she never really drove
and then she graduated from when she graduated from college and got that job working in new jersey my parents but she got like seventy eight grand a year like right outta college banking
uhuh
so my parents bought her a they bought her a new car
and and she just kept that car you know what i mean
where does she live now
uh princeton new jersey
she lives in jersey
yeah
does she does she like it over there
yeah bro she likes it a lot
and i i think the only reason she likes it that much though is because she started dating this kid like three or four years ago bro
i don't even remember how long ago
i think it was like three years ago
but he lives he's from pittsburgh
and he goes to school in arizona
and like right about the time that she like she got the job she graduated in uh fall in in spring of last year so o seven
uhuh
and then got the job like right after that
and for fall of o of o seven her boyfriend came back to pittsburgh to do internship with u_s view
and so they were right next to each other
why what does he what does he what is he studying
i think something something with business
like marketing or um management business management something like that
he's a smart kid bro
so so what it's like a long distance relationship
yeah it was
and and now and now he's back in arizona so
but whatever man i 've been working out for three years bro
i heard jersey is like a like it's a very like just the sun doesn't come out a lot and they got a lot of pollution
yes but that's how everything up north is like
bro when i up to new york with adam this summer um bro it just got uglier and uglier the higher
like the farther farther north you go it just gets uglier
like florida is chill and nice sunny like palm trees you know nice and green
and then you get to like atlanta
and it's kind+ a the same
unless you 're like in the city
yeah
whatever
and then in georgia and in north carolina
but were you there during the summer
bro i drove from orlando i drove from tampa well from four miles all the way to buffalo new york over the summer
cough
like couple like couple or three weeks before i started here at f_i_u at for for the fall
damn
but um it just gets uglier bro
it's all sunny because of the smog
because it's all like down here it's all like farming
yeah yeah
it's not like up up there
it's all like textiles and like factories and stuff
yeah
so it says like on the highways and stuff it says like oh smog alert today from five to seven p_m or whatever
and so it's always always just looks cloudy but it's not even clouds it's just smoke and fog and
that sucks man
yeah
but where she lives in princeton is like a nice area like a nice city in in new jersey so
it's a nice area
yeah i know
my boss my boss lived man i told you my boss is from jersey his whole life and he tells me that every day like he would just be depressed because like the sun barely comes out over there and
yeah
this is how it is up there

we went there with my grandmother
she used to have a house there
where was is it by
bro it's in new york or new jersey ah the hamptons
the hamptons
yeah we went there because she she had like a little house and we went there bro and it's mad nice mad nice because it's farther away from the city so there's not so much um smog in the air
yeah but i bet+ cha the water was freezing
cold cold it's always cold
and it was like ninety degrees out
like it was a nice day
and the water was like seventy like sixty seventy no matter what
was the water like like this like a dark color right
really dark
the sand is ugly bro
the sand is like south beach sand
for real
yeah it's like but it's real it's real sand
but it feels like the fake sand here
when i went to the canary islands it was it was january
and it was seventy degrees outside
but the water like the water there is like a dark dark dark blue
and you can just tell that the water is super cold
yeah
bro i wan+ na go to alaska and go fishing out there
alaska er i don't know
i'll' go maybe like on a cruise to alaska or something like that
i don't know about fishing all day
go on a fishing and hunting trip
fish in a hole

what are you gon+ na fish for man
whatever yeah i'm' like big tuna and stuff
yeah i guess so i was right
hunting go hunting for like elk do you go hunting a lot
no i 've never gone hunting
my cousin has gone hunting a lot
yeah i i didn't we went hunting a lot just because our are hunters
man in it's like it's big over there bro
but hunting like elk or something big like that bro that 'd be awesome
a bear
shoot a bear man
the the nicest beach i probably ever saw was in was when i went to cuba
i think the nicest beach i 've ever been to is in roatan bro
where's that
the island off the coast of honduras bro that place is beautiful man
and it's like
yeah
bro the water's like green like like that blue like light green because the sand is white
yeah yeah
it's like sand white soft sand
that's how all the beaches are in cuba
yeah
so um the the water's like really really green bro
it's clear
it's awesome
our house over there is sick bro
it's like a hour drive from the city
like there's like three islands that that make up roatan
and uh roatan is one of the islands
and i can't remember what the other two are called
but we have a house in roatan which is the biggest island
and like on this side on like the left side of the island is all like hotels marinas
like because it's huge on diving because like here come like here's honduras
and the islands are right here
and like all of this like off the coast of mexico and um and like um guatemala and stuff
all of that is is like the second largest uh coral reef formation in the world
all of that
what's it called
i can't remember
but it it like stretches all the way to roatan like it ends over there
some awesome fish in there huh
oh my god yeah bro and like diving is
that's where i went scuba diving for the first time
my dad learned how to how to scuba dive from jean michel cousteau
oh yeah
jean cousteau's son yeah
he did his first night dive with him and everything
they jumped out of a helicopter one time
into the water at night yeah
in a dive
when you when you you jump like that
and the the helicopter the helicopter is like twenty feet above the the water
and you just jump with with full gear yeah
no way
full gear
yeah
from like from like twice twice as high as as this
and how do you get picked up
the the um
a lift
the helicopter comes down with a yeah
what do you do
they have like a g_p_s on them or something for helicopters to find them at night time
they they you put a a buoy
there's a buoy in certain spots
and you have to come back to the buoy
and he said you have you have uh under water like ten or fifteen feet under water
there's a blinker that goes off on the buoy that you can see for like miles under water
for real
so you just have to like
because bro have you ever been night diving
no
i 've never been
but my dad told me like it's the sickest craziest feeling ever
because you can be be going down bro and you think you 're going up
you 're going up yeah
because you don't you don't realize it
so there's like he says there's like a blinking ball just like a big light bulb
and it just blinks and blinks and blinks like every two seconds
so and you see it
so um and it's like two it's like ten ten fifteen feet under water
so you just go back to that whenever your your tank's almost out
and the helicopter will come back
damn
yeah my grandmother bro the craziest story i 've ever heard
my dad told me that when he was out there building the house because my dad was in notre dame he took it took him six years to graduate
like the the the school of architecture at notre dame takes like four and a half to five years
like it's a four year program
uhuh
but if um like if you don't like do summer and all that stuff like it can take it usually takes people more than four years or whatever
but it took my dad six years because he took a year off and moved to roatan and built our house out there
wow
so he said that when he was out there um bro he was it was like three or four o'clock one afternoon
like they just got done working
he just like grabbed a beer and went down to like grabbed a case of beer and went down to the to the dock and our dock
um remember i told you my uncle had that shrimping company
yeah
my grandfather whatever
yeah
wow that's like a mile down
like we own all that land all that side of the island
my grandparents owned like the entirety of it
like they 've they 've sold a lot of it now
but we own like all of it so the the thing's like a mile down
and the water is really it's not like here the beach
like it stays steady
like it's a a steady drop
because it's like in a bay
like the island's right here
and there's a little island like a little island right here that used to be an air strip
and then the coral reef is back here
so the water goes deep really quick
so the the dock goes out like fifty feet because bro my grandfather used to have a fifty two foot yacht out there
and the water is like a hundred feet deep at the end of the yacht at the end of the dock
it's like a fifty foot dock
so he said they were in there building the the dock
and they were done with like the first um like twenty feet of the dock
and he said that he saw um a manta ray just like swimming bro
he just saw it go under the the dock like farther out and then come back
and then he just said that he heard like a big bang
and then he saw the dock like a piece of the dock fall into the water
and he said that there was like a twelve foot uh hammerhead shark that was chasing the manta ray
no way
and he he went underneath the the docks
and he broke the pilings there bro
it was probably like thirty feet deep forty feet deep where he hit it
and the pilings are big bro
and he just said that he broke right through them
and then they just kept going
oh my god
yeah bro
that's insane man
bro we 're planning a trip to honduras next summer
we 're definitely going out there for like a week
well uh the only time i went diving was in a lake man

so they made her a house over there
and it's like my cousin's house my grandmother's house's stables and then my house
so i was always at my grandmother's house with my cousin
like after school you just get dropped off there
and like just chill there all day
so we spent the night there
and like ten in the morning bro we were messing out in the backyard
and um i was like nine or ten and he was like twelve or thirteen
and bro he starts pissing
and like we were both pissing
and then like in the back of the of my grandmother's house
and um bro he's going and then he pees on me bro

and the and bro she gets there
and she came over like a little bottle of
because i guess when my cousin told her she didn't even think it was that bad
and bro she just looks at me

and it was like um bro i came right in
they took me in and and they put me to sleep like as soon as i got there

yeah
bro but that pain it was ridiculous like just threw i threw up in pain in my entire body
did you still have the stingers in when you went in
yeah i still had some of them
the guy the doctor said they probably all of them wouldn't even come out till the next day
no way
he was like do you wan+ na pull each one out like do it
but he was like we gave you something for the swelling so when the swelling the swelling will be gone by tomorrow and they'll' just pop out on their own

yeah
the one that we met
he went diving one time with a hose like you know they have the the pump on the top
yeah
yeah
and then you have another hose that you can use it like for lobstering
yeah
and he went to um he went on a he was using it one time and he got a bubble
in the hose
in a
or in his chest
in in his chest
no way
it was like a like something in his lung or something in his lung hey when he called he called the pharmacy asking my mum she's like she's like oh chief you know what i do uh
and bro when he when he was talking he sounded like he had a pinched nose he was talking like that like that was talking like that
yeah yeah yeah
that was dangerous
yeah you could die and he he went to the hospital and i think they said he had like a a a nitrogen mower or something built up in his in his lung something like that
bro that can't be healthy
he could 've died if if one of those um bowls goes to your brain you 're dead
done for it
bro my mom had she um she has to do with her lungs but she told me how she was gon+ na the club one day with some of her friends
and they were in honduras
and like they got in a car accident
and she had just gotten out of the car
and they went to like across the street to the gas station to to to get cigarettes or something
and they came back like they got in a bad accident or something
and and like the car had flipped or whatever
and but everybody there was fine like the girl that was in the passenger seat like went to the hospital and she broke her arm or whatever
and the dude that was driving was like no no i feel fine like my mother
and his mom was a doctor or whatever
so he was like i'm' just gon+ na go home and gon+ na have my mom look at it
and he went home
and um he died in his driveway bro in his car
yeah
his lungs
the seatbelt the seatbelt
yeah his lung um his uh one of his ribs broke and punctured his lung
his lung yeah
and he choke on his blood like horrible way to die
yeah that's how i remember it when man i told you man when you got that eye symptom to get checked out because that shit can happen
yeah definitely
you can you can't even notice that you you 're like injured profusely inside
yeah bro the next day i woke up and my back was killing me bro my back hurt so bad
no not even that you could have internal bleeding somewhere and not even know it
yeah
bro that scared that scared bro that was scaring me straight though like i haven't even thought about it for so long
yeah man
it was probably the worst thing that's happened to me in a year
bro i can't one year eating on my street
yeah i figure
yeah bro
that i was he was gon+ na be looking like at your surroundings when you 're driving

and try not to pay attention to other things because you only have like that one little second
a split second man
to react and if you don't you 're you 're yeah you 're done
you 're done bro
that's so crazy man
that happened to my dad when he was a little kid when he was fifteen he got hit by an eighteen-wheeler he was crossing the street and the driver didn't see him and he nailed him he was in a coma for like a long time
the doctor said that he was in that he wasn't gon+ na make it that he was gon+ na die
damn
if you look at his face like if you look at his um like at his eyebrow
how fast was in the eighteen-wheeler
i don't know but you know way
mile an hour
yeah it was an eighteen-wheeler man do you know how much weight that thing has behind it

and the doctors said the my grandma would say oh you know what what can you do for him dies like ah it's it's in god's hands now

*herring17.csv*
there are plenty of new um alternatives
aha
regarding um birth control pills
yeah
but ah they they they they 're not as strong as they were a couple of years ago
yeah
like ah like ah in the sixties they were terrible
yeah
yeah they were
like too strong
too too much strong
too much
yeah no no
but now the dose is so slight
basically
but look at this
i wan+ na i wan+ na do more natural things because i really
i'm' already on medication
i'm' already on effexor
and i 've been on antidepressants since i was seventeen
so i 've already been fucked
you know i 've already had my body being dependent on on medicine
i don't wan+ na take even more medicine if i could find something else that helps me
but i wouldn't say that hormones are
i don't know
for me it's a natural way to regulate stuff
yes but
but i could find
yeah but those things those things are synthetic hormones
that's why they 're more powerful
they have more side effects
that's the problem
and i know i know i have to do i i have to be better about my diet and all that stuff
i have to eat healthier
i'm' actually starting to eat
yeah it's genetic because my mom
so it's not ah it's not something that was like
these these pills
i think that they need to consider your ah weight and blood type and stuff
when they do a good one ah ah like let's say a costumised ah homeopathic stuff
the thing is i went to
like if this is generic ah i think it's it's ah still effective
it's still effective
i know i know
i know i need to find i need to find
mmhm
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
that's the thing
i 've been
this why that's what i think
i 've been
this this might be even more effective if a real homeopathic doctor like
this is all prescribed
i i need to go to a good homeopath
and the thing is that they 're not all of them a lot of them are not covered under regular health insurance
mmhm
so you have to pay the whole
you have to pay extra
i don't know maybe later ah in a couple of minutes we can check some books there in
yeah yes this is also good
i was gon+ na say starbucks eh barnes and noble because
i'm' also
there's always ways that you can help yourself
that's why i also have that
it's a massage oil
so you have your kit
like herbs and natural components whatever
yes
it might help
but the good stuff is that it's never gon+ na do anything like wrong to you like it's not gon+ na affect you negatively
that's why i like it
and there might be a a good effect
lavender
eh
they so they dilute
so by the way
sometimes sometimes you you get words in english
and you force them to look like spanish
yeah exactly
yeah
sometimes you can guess that
and sometimes you can make it like
but dilute it's not how how do you say
i don't know
it's good that you 're doing this stuff
and and you have your things to take care of yourself
it's good
it's good
but still i what i was telling you is that we can check a couple of books and maybe ah like self help something
and i actually need to check some books for myself
a woman and i have woman's dong quai tonic
ginger
ginger
eh eh
ginger
ginger
ginger snaps ginger cookies
ginger ginger ginger
how do you call those ah seeds that ah buns have when you are having a hamburger
no no no it's sesame
and they have those
oh yeah
ginger
but it's not for cooking
it's like a little bitter
like strong
eh fennel
eh dandelion
and how long
how long are your eh periods
for how long
three days five six
fuck
for having inherit
and she is like you 're welcome
exactly
oh that's a huge inconvenience
yeah i know
seven days
ah
you know you you know what
consider all the all the facts of ah just been a woman
it's just yeah it's a pain of fucking ass
yeah like quarter of the time you have blood in yourself like you are bleeding
yes
like one week every four
no every
yeah
mmhm
so like a quarter
quarter of the month you are bleeding
and then you can have your own pleasure and eh have sex and whatever
but if you get pregnant you need to give birth through there
yeah
and it's painful
i don't like like natural birth
for me natural birth it's just unnatural
you think it's barbaric
yeah it is
it was another way for god to punish people
women once again
it is not gon+ na
no i know that it i i i
but the the person will be able to keep the same shape and the the muscle tone and everything
yeah
i am thinking that
well
why would i want it that that way like eh i don't know it's so uncomfortable
it it's gon+ na most likely the person is gon+ na be like loose
and that's why you do kegel muscles
oh not enough
i wouldn't say that it's enough
i don't know
i don't like that
ah you know that i i have blood phobia
did you know that
what
blood phobia
in spanish is hematofobia
ah who likes to see blood
no one
but i can i i could faint
you 're just like my dad
i'm' i'm' becoming stronger
but ah like ten years ago
no
my dad was just the same
if if if i happen to see like running blood or something like that i feel disgust and i feel weak and i
it's like my type kryptonite
that's the point about freaking where i always
kryptonite yeah
so it's not just about a loose vagina
it's about blood too
i do not like when i don't know people is bleeding
yeah
i i could faint as i told you
and i'm' becoming stronger
but um how can i say this
once i was um giving blood
mmhm
and ah this black guy that it was doing it was so careless
mmhm
once again we 're talking about that
and the guy i i told him i told i told him
and we 're talking about we 're talking about niggers not black people
don't say that
eh the the
there's a difference
there's a difference
what
i i i don't wan+ na talk about that because we already talked about that
ok
ok yeah yeah yeah
and um
i don't know
ok ok yeah
he was being careless
so yeah even if he's black or not um
i ah
not always expect the best type of service from ah from
from health people
especially health
i don't know
i guess
i told him i told him clearly clearly
ah i i'm' i'm' more than happy to give blood i am gon+ na try but i i have blood phobia and i could faint so i need you to be close to me and talk to me and stuff like that for me not to think about what i am doing and feel and imagine what i'm' doing because
mmhm
i yeah
it it could happen if i if if my mind is focused on that
yeah
you got a hot flush
hot flushes
ok
he was just negligent
because i told him i i i could faint
yeah
so be here
and talk to me like
exactly
i don't know
if i'm' doing this for you because i do not like it and i know that i could faint
mmhm
mmhm
i'm' doing it because i wan+ na be nice and maybe help a child or something like that
mmhm
but he just left me there
so i fainted
mmhm
and when i faint i pulled my my my arm and it removed the needle
mmhm
so there was blood all around the floor
oh
and and i just fainted
and it was so deep
and i felt like shit
have you fainted some once or
when they ah i almost fainted right after the when they did this
yeah
because i was like freaking out about the pain
so
it was painful
they
it was painful
i was just like thinking
i was like tired
i was really
it's just a piercing you know
i know
and the needle
type of piercings
those are even more painful
i know i know
it's crazy
it's like ah
they had to
it's like it's like you 're dying
i know
like you feel like you 're losing yourself
like oh my god
and fuck and you feel so weak and helpless
i almost fainted no i almost fainted at the at at at ah his place
you have no idea what it is to be actually in that position
so i had
it happened to me like five times or six
and it's
oh i hate it
no no what i'm' trying to tell you is i did not faint
but i was this close to fainting because i threw up
not the same stuff
what if you start to faint
i can understand
would you would you
no you you have no idea
when you actually faint when you lose your ah consciousness you feel like crap
consciousness
it's even worse
because i have been in your
no no no no no
stop
oh
remember wisdom
continue
mmhm
ok
ah i have felt like you like you have like you have felt like ah i'm' about to to lose my consciousness
mmhm
yeah
and it's terrible
it's not nice to be in that position
but actually losing the consciousness is worst
mmhm ok
so you do not know that part
ok
so it has has happened to me that i have like lost my consciousness
and it's terrible
it's like um a small death
mmhm
something like that
so then i have plenty of reasons for not ah i don't know support natural birth
mmhm
it's so unnatural and painful
mmhm
and most likely the person is gon+ na get a loose vagina
mmhm
and even the doctor put the hands inside the vagina to pull the placenta
mmhm
yeah
yeah yeah
placenta how do you say that
the placenta
yeah placenta
in english
placenta
that's that's it
how do you pronounce it
placenta
placenta
yeah
ok so so the doctor takes the placenta out of the woman like pulling it with with his own
yeah
like the whole hand goes inside
and it's so barbaric
yeah
and
and it's not just about our myself and my pleasure but about the blood and and
mmhm
i don't know
it's it's it's terrible
ah
it's terrible
i don't know
people people
i don't know
there there there should be like ah some sort of device to have children
like put them like in some sort of microwave or something like an oven
like the how do you say that
that's
when when when it's growing
you 're talking about infertile
you 're talking about instead of having inside
no that's that is fucked up
that is the most fucked up thing i 've ever heard you say
because the baby's supposed to be inside the woman
i'm' just joking
i'm' just joking
oh ok
but it would be so convenient
it would
can you imagine let's see our fetus it's on the microwave growing
no no that's that's fucked up
and you open there and you
i'm' telling you that's fucked up man
no no but but what if
i don't know
it would be so unnatural to have a child like growing like a fetus outside the woman
and and and and and i know it's only this this is the un bebe de laboratorio
yeah the the whole nine months in the lab
i know
it's gon+ na become a product sooner than later
let's buy a baby
that's i know that's
let's get a baby
mmhm
oh stem cell
stem cell
yeah i have no idea about that
no let's not talk about that
it's like kind of using fetus to
i don't know something
let's go back to this
ay no more no more
i don't want more
no
what dong quai
no more herbs and stuff
boring stuff
do you ever hear me talk about that like um
i know but i didn't finish reading it
ok man read it
read all of them
it has er er stinging nettle
organic dong quai
that's the ah that's the chinese
the ching chang chong chong
a p_m_s lollipop
yeah
with what
it it's actually
no that's just me that's just before
kosher
dong quai
so it's it's not intended for helping you with your p_m_s
no that's just me because i bought it yesterday
dong quai root extract juniper berry extract organic orange oil
looks like a lollipop made out of herbs or something
stevia
stevia leaf
oh stevia
stevia's good
yeah i know
i know
that that regulates your blood sugar
stevia
stevia
so expensive
it is
have you tried it
the natural one
yeah this is all natural
no but ah
organic
no no i i i mean the the leaves
the leaves
the leaves itself
and you know what is stevia
it's like a plant that grows in chile
yeah
in chile
recently discover i don't know but um the fact is that er might be ah the next big thing to replace sugar or
aha
um
ayurdeva
ayurdeva
ayurdevic ayurvedic
um
you know that i used to be a hare krishna
yes you told me
and i used to be a lot of things
so let's let's count them down
oh the list is huge
i know
you told me it was eighteen
um you might not know about some of them like er espiritismo
but not like in the movies like oh my god
it's not like a medium like with blank eyes like doing weird stuff
just some way to relax and get in touch with a um spirit that eh has some wisdom
the the chakras
yes
not any other spirit
aha
depends on the medium
aha
but what happens is that they they they make connection
and the spirit speaks about the medium like through the medium
mmhm
and i found it really interesting
so in that group i i happened to learn about the real espiritismo
mmhm
how do you say that in english
like spiritism
no er it's called um new age
aha
aha
aha
eh and i was looking for eh ah third type encounters
how you call those
yeah
then i became a hare krishna part time
mmhm
a part time hare krishna
yeah
so i used to be like vegetarian
but sometimes i had my my meat
mmhm
and i went to this um a ceremonias
and i used to sing with them and stuff like that but just part time
oh it was so i
aha
aha
mmhm
it's like marketing
so they sing and they get free food from the market people
mmhm
i don't know
they they give away food
they prepare the food
and if there's a homeless guy or someone they have like meetings
and they they they give away people for food
but you need to first listen the bhagavad gita
and then you get the soup
so if you 're hungry you can become a hare krishna
just get the soup and then get the bhagavad gita and sing with us and dance with us and
it's kind of a manipulation
it's it's it's it's marketing
it's a good way to i don't know give someone a a bowl of soup and some i don't know comfort for the soul
ok so it's a mission
we give you food
and if you wan+ na hear about er jesus christ that's fine
you 're more than welcome
but a couple of centuries ago you do not wan+ na hear about jesus christ so you are gon+ na lose your head
i know
decapitated
we have come we have come a long way por lo menos
yeah but we were counting
like hare krishna
and i had well my mantras and my stuff hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare
aha
aha
hmm
hmm
aha
aha
eh rosacrucismo
mmhm
el cuarto camino
aha
mm
satia saibaba
and and then i just read that er i wasn't able to find god or find inner peace
mmhm
so i just eventually stopped looking
and i became a rebel
and i just told
yeah like just told jesus or whatever god or representation there was at that time in my mind it's ok i'm' just tired of looking for you and i got nothing i feel nothing i i haven't got any more faith so i'm' just gon+ na stop looking if you wan+ na see me just look for me so i'm' not gon+ na look for you
mmhm
mmhm
um i don't know
then i became a atheist and then agnostic and plenty of stuff
and then i came here to the u_s seven years ago
and attend like christian meetings and christian churches and stuff
and at the end i just realised that i am just a catholic person that wants to be better
and er i don't know i'm' just trying to be a good man
ay
mmhm
ravers
ravers
rave music
so like techno music
isn't that the one that people use to get stoned or get high with these ecstasies
i have never tried ecstasies
i just smoked marijuana for a couple of years
just minor stuff
marijuana just
but you know what
what
i i wan+ na try sooner or later in my life at least once l_s_d
at least once
it was something natural
so then it's not l_s_d
l_s_d is totally a chemical stuff
that has nothing to
well l_s_d l_s_d is is is er is made in a lab
i i
so it's some sort of seed that cause the same effect like l_s_d or something like that
yes
yes
yes
but they 're some sort of mushrooms or something like that
i might try something natural maybe
i know about your experience
but you know what
still
i told you the other day
er sometimes life is like flat
like without i don't know intereses o intensidades o
mmhm
sometimes just being an adult is a little boring
yes i know
and you can drink sometimes
mmhm
and you feel different
could be nice to drink once in a while
mmhm
you can smoke cigarettes which is stupid
mmhm
the worst thing that you can do
like marlboro ones
mmhm
you can smoke some marijuana
that i used to smoke marijuana
and for me it was great
mmhm
um
and i experienced nothing wrong about that and nothing
but er i never tried any anything else
mmhm
so there wasn't for me any other way to feel what i felt through marijuana just with marijuana
no
even i i can experience what is love um what it is to drink
different things
but what marijuana marijuana made me feel nothing else would have made me feel
mmhm
you understand what i'm' saying
yes completely understand
and it's just marijuana for a couple of years
mmhm
so er and i just stopped doing it
mmhm
it was so easy to just not do it i just decided not to do it
and i stopped doing it
but still i know that there are some ways to feel things in life that just flat main basic emotions are not gon+ na make you feel
just like that
because i i i might love someone
yeah the holy spirit is nice but er but er ah
i do not have faith
because
i i was not raised to have faith
and i have looked for that
and i i wanted to have faith but er
i'm' still a very nice person and i i
but you know what
i am actually one of the
i don't know
i consider myself a useful person a nice person that has been doing nice stuff for people all his life
yeah
i i always have been useful
so i'm' a good citizen
yeah
and maybe not really with a big faith
but um i have been better than other people that have faith and has done bad stuff
aha
mmhm
just give a try once
and something that is gon+ na make me feel something different and nice
exciting
something
i don't know er an experience out of myself
something
and i i have heard that l_s_d can make you feel like that
yeah yeah
yeah
so just once maybe
and then keep on with my life
i i might never do it but
you grind them
ok
you grind them

and what about the other team machine the other fast machine

did you download did you download the
there is no downloading
so how do you gon+ na pass from the from the computer to the
that thing work together
i don't know

i'll' figure it out
you can go home
so so why 'd i make more than last time
how many hours did you work last time
same
no you didn't you couldn't have possibly made the same
no
why not
eighty hours you worked last week
yeah
ah no jack i don't think so
ok
sixty eight
that that's it
that's your difference right there
sixty eight
no
how many hours
seventy six
that's right
no that's right
because you 're only looking at about twenty four bucks difference
no a little bit more
it was uh seven what
uh seven something
seven
looks
hold on
if you 're looking at twelve times
eighty
eighty
so you had like forty four hours
more that's it
you had four hours more
ah ok
four times twelve
four
four time twelve
four time doce
so you 're looking
so when she got there
she says you know i'm' here to do my orientation
i said well i'm' sorry but the office is closed
we close at seven
well clare said
so call her right now
i said you know clare doesn't do orientations
but i can call my office right now
so i picked up the phone
and magdalena
i said magdalena i have someone who she's finished closing
and they told her to cross the street and that you would do an orientation
magdalena says no i'm' closed i can't do an orientation i was told not to do any overtime
so i proceeded to hang up the phone
and i said i'm' so sorry the office is closed there's not much i can do
and she just got all wired up
and she's like call clare call clare
and as she does this her boyfriend sees how or her friend i don't know if boyfriend or friend
did you call clare
no
what for
she was calling her on her cell phone
oh
and you know i picked up the phone
i gave her the number
and she's verified the number that she had
and i said yeah that's that's the number
so i hang up my phone and let her call her
she her boyfriend said well let's just go across the street
so they went across the street
and got clare
clare was well clare was clare
walks all you know huffing and puffing
we need we need to go and and pick up the bicycle
which one
oh ok
jacob
hey wait a second
let me finish my story
yeah what
because i haven't told you what happened
ok so this whole story right
and then this morning she came
again
well yeah because we didn't do the orientation yesterday
mmhm
and um she made a complaint against me
so karen calls me
and she says um i have a resident who just made a complaint about you
and i said well karen um that's why i came into the office this morning at ten thirty to tell you i needed to speak to you
she's like oh is it on the report
i said it sure is it's on the report today and yesterday
she says well we need to extend more courtesy
i said hold on one second did you see how excited she is did you know how upset she was yesterday
because they kept her four hours just sitting there waiting for clare
she's like oh you 're right ok well
she's like ok you yeah i think you ok you did fine
and that was it
but yeah karen was at first you know just dumping it on me
and i was like um this woman
i wasn't gon+ na stay
and and and and yeah and and right in the front desk
i don't do orientation
i was like
where you 're sitting is karen's telephone number
yeah but no
it wasn't my place to call karen
it would already
no you don't have to call nobody
you just give the card to her
no no i did
i gave i gave her the office card
and she didn't want it
she wanted clare
so she went and got clare
end of story
but then this morning she was complaining about me
and i was like it's not my office i don't do orientation
why was she complaining about me
she's like well i guess you because you didn't call clare
and i was like why do i have to call clare she had her on the cellphone
so anyways that was what happened today
so i was a little annoyed
but then i was like ah i'll' get over it what's the worst thing that can happen to me
i'll' just walk across the street
and ask the engineer there if they can give me a job
actually if they offer me twelve thirteen i will walk across the street
yeah it's the same
same shit
same shit different
that's TRUE it's the same train
i can just hop on and hop off at the same time
on friday i have to go with you
where
at seven
you have to go with me at seven
at seven into work
why
because i'm' covering for claudio
ah
uhhuh
we can move over there if you want
no
you wan+ na move to the sofa
no
ok
oh well so the only reason i kind of figured it out was because she said oh yeah claudio cooked
i'm' like how can claudio cook claudio went home
and i'm' thinking oh claudio went home
home home
mommy's house
so anyways
ah jack i need you to call the people for the title
i don't know the phone number
you need to tell them you paid ten dollars for them to do a title search
yeah
the lady says we'll' call you don't call us
she could've just put those ten dollars in her pocket
she gave me a receipt though
i don't know where's the receipt right now
ok ah i'm' so glad she gave you a receipt
in that receipt's surely there is a telephone number
maybe
well could you find it please
i'll' find it yeah
i need to know what the hell is going on with that
did i show you how much i got paid
i didn't get paid as much as you
but i think this is not by much short four hours short
so last week you were four hours short
this week i'm' four hours short
because remember that day of training
they only paid me for four hours
so that's gon+ na be eight
but it doesn't matter because that's what they pay
this is what this is what counts
this is what the number that we got+ ta look at
seven eight nine
you think
alright
ninety five
and then here it is four four
and seven six
that would be nine
that's a two
oh
so five and four
and four is nine carry the one
no no don't carry nothing
nine and four thirteen and that's four
because it's five five and and four is nine
oh my god
why you have to carry something
because i don't carry you carry
ah
ok nine that's thirteen carry the one six seven eight nine
and that would be eight
and that would be
fourteen
uhhuh
ok so that's what we have right now
and upstairs i have about that much
and then there's another envelope with that
that would be nine
that's still eight
ok so that's what i have right now
what
i know but i'm' always getting used to just counting one two three four
i don't know
i'm' slow with that
how do i know without actually counting that
makes no sense
ok so anyways
i'm' i'm' sure this can be rounded off but
in the i can round it off to two
just two period
ok forget that
i don't have to do that
ok listen
this is what i need right now
this is right
this is insurance
and this is car payment
that would be four and eleven right
uhhuh
don't laugh at me weirdo
now i still have no idea what the registration to your vehicle is
you 're so piggish
ok so
rent insurance car
so i still have
i know just give me a few minutes
that's only because you wan+ na eat at a restaurant
if i have to cook it's not so much
no it didn't have to be in the restaurant
what do you wan+ na do
i'm' talking about something that i like to eat
what would you like to eat
are you gon+ na find something en el carrito
i not i not talking about restaurant
that's because that's the first thing that comes to my mind every time somebody says something to eat i
yeah but but i
i'm' not talking about restaurant
i'm' talking about something that i like to eat
don't have to be restaurant
ok
ew
i'm' not going with you
where you going
i don't like to eat hotdogs
why not
uhhuh
wow
uhhuh
hmm
ok
like chilli
ok
oh ah
alright
yup
what does that mean
well yeah it'll' be fun
she's thirteen fourteen
she's not gon+ na like the same things that he likes
he's seventeen oh almost seventeen
that's gon+ na be a real challenge
why
look
they start in june twenty-fifth
say that i bring her the first week
it doesn't matter
for how long she coming
she only comes for one week
that's what she told me
and for how do you think that she he he he is gon+ na be here longer than her
he's gon+ na wan+ na stay longer
like uh two weeks
like three months
like three months
oh my
i don't know
he was talking about some stuff
some stuff
what kind of stuff
stuff
um no they have the his dad is just
mean
yeah
he is letting him down his father
he is letting his father down
i think that's what frustrates him the most
so when i tell him
just just come and live with me
the problem
is like uh uh
he says then my father is just gon+ na say i'm' running away from my problem
which is TRUE what he is gon+ na say
but
oh well let him to decide
the moment's gon+ na come anyway
maybe he
the moment is gon+ na come
but it's gon+ na be ugly
ah well
the problem that that's not the problem
the problem is that the father is trying to do the same that he do when he was the baby's age
no
no rupert never has wanted mucho asi asi tampoco
mmhm
i know
i know
i didn't like that but
paco is a really responsible kid
i mean considering
he i mean i i'm' not saying that he is right
but you know he could be doing so many other stuff
he could be besides failing because well he is failing in some of his classes
he
ok ok let's think about a normal family
no normal kid runs a company
well let's just not call it a company
no normal kid would be able to pick up a phone talk to another adult
let him know what time the job is gon+ na happen
call employees
and tell them what time they need to be somewhere at fourteen at fifteen
mmhm
you know kids that the only thing they think about is when they 're gon+ na get their new shoes

i need to give the tickets to the other teachers for the stuff that i turned in
and i'll' take paco
ok what time are you leaving
when the house is picked up
oh so that would mean you know tomorrow or something like that
oh ok so then you can stay her finish picking up the house
i'll' pick up just a little bit
i'm' not gon+ na pick up the whole thing
ok
i mean esmerelda's room is disgusting
she needs to pick that up
and paul's not here
i imagine he went to work
mmhm
why don't you take some tylenol
i am i'm' gon+ na take some
and as usual
i put it next to your side of the bed
as usual every time easter comes
and i have to do all this stuff in the in the parish
i get sick
gordo is sick too
i don't know how many times he kicked me in the bed
no
i don't remember him kicking me
so he must have been facing me the whole time
no it was me
it was me
he was kicking me the whole time
i didn't sleep very well either
i was waking up at three and at four and at five
i slept pretty well
yeah i know you did
you were snoring
yeah i must have slept well
and quite loud i might add
and paco was snoring really loud too
so anyway
i'm' gon+ na go drop that off at the motor home when i leave for the parish
um yesterday the principle called me in
she goes i wan+ na talk to you before i i speak to that teacher
the one that has that problem
yes
and um and i go um i wan+ na i wan+ na speak to you before i talk to her because i want the union to be ok with this
she goes to me
and uh and i go ok
and so i go to her yeah well you know let me know about about what's going on
and she goes no i'm' telling you what i'm' planning to do because you know when when she comes in she's probably gon+ na be upset or whatever she might come to you
ok
oh because she's coming back to work
she came back to work
she came back to work
yeah you know i was mentioning that you know people talk about the catholic church and how um priests that molest children like get transfered
just get transfered from one place to another and the school system is doing the same thing
but but the school system is about just about the same category then
because her dad is an attorney and her brother is an attorney
so they 're more scared of the lawsuit than they are of ethical things
right they 're more scared of the lawsuit from her the employee than the lawsuit from the parents
yeah
because the the parents didn't do anything but the parents are more concerned and took them out took the kids out
imagine that's a free program
you know and so anyhow um she goes
she had come to me the principle had come to me a couple days ago and she goes um the person that you sent me an email and the resume do you know them personally
and i go truthfully no i know her boyfriend um i know her via email but you know because you know we 've gone back and forth
then she is in a position where she wants to
who's this
the manager of payway
oh ok yeah
but he but he
right right right that she was in that school in
she's in belair
she's in belair
she's in fifth grade
e_s_e
well that's exactly what she needs over here
so then tell them that they have to leave again
no no
because she's been working there less than three years
she has to get that approved
she you know it's the bureaucracy
it takes a while
even though they 're in the system they 're somewhere else so it has to get approved by the district the the the change
even if
even the principals and stuff right
the principal
you you remember what i went through ok
and so she goes
because i had told her if she comes back what we need to do is don't put her in don't put her in that classroom put her in a higher grade you know where kids can talk and kids can talk and kids can tell you exactly what's going on
and so she goes yeah but i think she's only certified for pre-k
well perfect
and she is emotionally
put her put her with six grades six grades
no no we don't have six grade
oh that's right
fifth grade
put her put her with fifth grade students
they will eat her alive
then she'll' leave
she goes
i go no
you know
she's great
but she's new
she asks people
you know er the person that gave her the position or whatever
and told her listen look at what she's you know certified in
because that's what that's the first thing i had asked her
what is she certified in
put her somewhere else
but i guess she hadn't really done any until she you know somebody told her how to do it
eh she has every right to do so
whether i like it or not that's i mean they should take that into consideration
but they don't have to
but at any rate didn't they get somebody to replace her while she was gone
they had a sub
and so what happened when this woman came back
well she requested not to have the people that you know made the allegations in the classroom
and she said look i 've nowhere else to put them
so she obviously felt very uncomfortable working there
good
mmhm mmhm
oh yeah
they 're emotionally you know disabled
e_s_e is really really really difficult
mmhm mmhm
like a c_s_t it's like a it's it's a child study team
so she was meeting with some parents and a counselor whatever
so she wasn't in the classroom
how could this child just walk out
the child snuck out
but this is from your school
yeah from her class
where are you going
ok hurry up because i don't want you to leave your brother out there alone
and um the the child snuck out
so she the principal went in there to try to see how could this happen and how to prevent it from happening again
around the park people walk around
because it was nap time
i know she was in a meeting during that time
she goes yeah but it's her classroom
so she doesn't she doesn't give a damn about the kids
no she doesn't
of course she doesn't
she doesn't have plans
she doesn't have you know she comes up with things a+ l ultimo minuto
she was
absolutely
so i'm' going by the contract
yeah
i think katie is gon+ na start in a school in june
she already resigned
mmhm well i don't know if she's resigned
but she hasn't signed the contract yet
then she hasn't resigned
but um i think they started calling people down to sign their contracts on thursday
mmhm
i mean not thursday yesterday
yesterday was wednesday
but yeah yesterday
no yesterday was thursday
yes
no wednesday
i'm' sorry
they started calling um people down
so i imagine that they'll' be calling her soon to go sign her contract
and then the nun said that er to see if she could be coming in you know at some point maybe for like a week or something
just to see how things are
and then and then probably start in june to try and get the
it may be better for her not to
for you and for her
they are gon+ na come to me
right
so
what i told her is get your certification in social studies so that you can work at at a public school
exactly
and then she told me no janet was saying that in ferguson there is gon+ na be openings for six new teachers in every department
and i go well there is your entry right there
exactly
you know
there's always openings in
and she said yeah but you know i don't wan+ na work in public schools
and i go well you know what if you work in a public school you are gon+ na make more money than what i'm' making right now
ok
and i said so go ahead and start doing that and the only way you are gon+ na get fired is if you do something to one of the kids
but yes unless you have during the first thirty days or first day they have the option to you know if they see that you you are really bad they can throw you out within the first thirty days
come on
it was a teacher
he's such a jerk
yeah i know
i can't stand him
that there was a teacher
mmhm
that they had you know done a whole bunch of things
i know exactly who they were talking about from you know from the school i was at before
and i go did you get hired somewhere else
and if they were sick and they were out they would ask them what did you have oh no i you know i i had you know a stomach virus oh a stomach virus ok
she would come back and say no she's sick
and she goes she she would er ask for worker's compensation because she got the stomach virus from a kid in the class
how do people like that get jobs
that's not the worse
oh that's the one that you caught going through your desk over here
yeah no not here
at the other right
at at at the other one
right right right
that's just amazing to me
ok
that's the thing that's the thing with my school since we work on contract
you break your contract you 're out
they have to
here they give you the opportunity to put you on a a an an improvement plan
and if you don't improve then it takes a long time
no no i mean here they you know we try to help you out
a lot of bureaucracy
you know we'll' put a mentor
we'll' give you ideas
we'll' talk to you but if it doesn't improve you 're out
you 're out
i wish they would do that with the kids
you know
because the parents in essence sign a contract with you know with the kids when they get there which is the handbook
you break that you should be out
right
oh no no no but the kids continue to go
you know
it's just i don't know
it really bothers me
i'm' looking for a rough year next year i'm' telling you
it's gon+ na be rough
i have the teachers on one side expecting me to do everything
i have
i don't know
yeah i'll' tell her
right
because father derrik used to bring people all the time but that was him but now father nichols is gon+ na be doing the same thing so
i'm' hungry
i'm' still having coffee
i already had my coffee
i'm' hungry
that sounds pretty good
i guess we could hop in the car with it and go get it
it's portable
do you wan+ na
no
just hop in the car and go get some pastelitos
no
yeah he could be baby-sitting
he's outside right now
i mean apparently he's keeping the kids entertained
oh
and my cyberloafing paper
i have six pages
it has to be ten
i don't know what i'm' gon+ na do that paper on
so i need to come up with more
i have no idea
what ethical
come on you 've you must have done it something like that person coming
what ethical dilemma do i have in my place of business
let me see
i hate my boss
i think she's a hypocrite
ah my ethical dilemma
the fact that i'm' choosing to work with her closer now in my new position
that's my ethical dilemma
i don't know how i'm' gon+ na work that out
isn't there something you done in saint thomas about ethics
and it really bothers me that peter got a the same thing that i got
how do you know
you don't know this
because everybody was saying it
everybody got a twenty on their presentation
i mean come on
my presentation was a hell of a lot better than a lot of other people's there

*herring8.csv*
so he goes over to the kreepy krauly and he pulls it out the pool and one leg is broken
that's why it wasn't moving
the pump was good
but he replaced the seal the o-rings
and how much did he charge
a hundred and twenty dollars
and how much would it been if we went and got the gauge and the and fixed the kreepy krauly up
the kreepy krauly would have been maybe thirty bucks if i would have gone
but i didn't know it was broken
and the gauge thing the pressure
the gauge thing he replaced it
uh i don't know how much that cost me but uh the visit alone was sixty
and then he replaced the o-rings which really
this is the bill guy
yeah bill
did you ask him about the pool heater
or you didn't ask
you know he said he said listen um uh
because i told him about my brother-in-law and everything
goes
listen i guarantee you he's gon+ na get you a better price than my boss is gon+ na let you let me sell you one for
and what about installing installing it
no installing if we have this guy
or paul
i'll' call
with paul
because then
and he is he is gon+ na school now
and he has the
the company
the grass isn't growing here
and where's the gak thing you 're saying was coming out of it
look you see it
no
coming out of the
white little exhausts
no not really
if you stand up and look it looks like slime
looks like gak
but has it gone better since you cleaned the footer
no
he says has to come over and do a um
coil cleaning
a coil cleaning
but the guy that installed the antenna said that not to touch it that that's poisonous and corrosive and uh
ay
paul said no it's just dirt and and water that's accumulated
it's not toxic
it's not corrosive
it's nothing
i have to jump in the pool tomorrow at some point
i hope it's warm
because i got+ ta to put the the drain the blocker on the drain so the kreepy krauly doesn't get stuck and
and it's clean
it's gon+ na be cold
it's clean
i want the heater
would be nice
it should be coming in soon
ten to twelve days
wednesday
eight to fifteen days
he they said ten to twelve
eight to fifteen
it said it on the package
eight to fifteen business days
mmhm
today counts as a business day
yeah
so we went on thursday
uh
yeah we went on thursday
yeah
so today is the eighth
today is the eighth so any time after this
yeah
what time do you have to be at the workshop tomorrow
eight o'clock in miami springs
what time do i have to leave
there's no traffic
seven twenty leave at seven thirty
did i tell you that julie's going
but does julie know if you can apply then for mentoring points
julie said you could
so if you go to the workshop you can
she's mentoring
so she's mentoring and she's gon+ na be able to count all the points
yeah
all the hours
yeah but i think she's just gon+ na scam it and uh you know mark the ones she's already done because there was a certain number that you had to have
there's no way you can do ninety from now to march thirty-first unless you 're sleeping with the person and living with the person
maybe they'll' the last batch
yeah but i know that you had to input it prior to
like now like they have like little deadlines that you have to input like the hours that you had before january
you have to put the hours before january the hours before february the hours before march
oh you just ninety hours of mentoring
no i know
and the truth of the matter is you have
and i know i 've done the ninety hours
i just
and i'm' giving you mine
mmhm no you can't give me yours
i was telling gloria
i will though
um i was telling gloria that after i stayed with janet till ten o'clock at night you know and we 're late and everything uh she e-mails me today i'm' not gon+ na be able to video the second lesson again you know i'm' just what i have
i hate when people do that
i don't know if i told you that
and i just didn't respond
and i told gloria because
sunshine
hundred percent if she's not gon+ na give herself a hundred percent
it's not worth it
i have enough to do
i 've to work on the fricking formatting crap
sunshine be careful
it was very minor what they told me i had to change
what
centering a page
but you see what i'm' saying is they should not give you because they 've asked you to format a thousand different ways
they should have one person at the end of the process once everything's approved um doing the formatting
ok you need to change this and this
what that's what the college
so should have one person in charge of of formatting
in the college of education they hire mrs dr blap to do that
but they submitted my dissertation with those formatting issues because they knew that it would still pass for the defense
some of the catches she didn't catch
and she caught things that they didn't catch
i was looking today
oh
uhuh
and i was watching this from rosa's bedroom
and uh i would see that she would be looking at them and talking on the phone and
they would catch passes in front of her
when have they ever decided to play football here
two weeks ago
when we had the music playing
mmhm
we should get
did you saw that orange gatorade thing from when you 're coaching
yeah
we should every now and then have
why what's wrong with mary
and they probably go into mary's house i think all the time and drink
we need to be supplying our them with drinks
when i was a kid you know we used to do
we used to get the hose and drink from the hose
if they 're too prissy to drink from the hose then let them go inside and get drinks
ok they have not
i'm' not gon+ na be supplying little thing
they the next thing you know i 'd be taking pictures of them as they 're playing basketball
and he is a
uh
my grass isn't growing
i'm' not happy
you know why
because these trees block the sunlight
and why do the why does it have to be grass here
i like it grass
what else would you recommend
pebbles mulch
mulch do you think i should
i have two bags of mulch i can lay
look it it it the shade is completely covering it
i have hope
and you never know if birds have eaten the seeds
sunshine
no
bird can't even see the seeds
they don't see worms either yet they eat them
yeah they see the worms
they dig into the ground to get a worm
she has something in her tail
sunshine
no
ah
she hasn't been bathed
she took her in the morning like she was gon+ na bathe her
huh
she's coming
eh
no
i think they 're all enjoying t_v
i didn't think anybody was gon+ na be at work today
sunshine get away from that cactus
ah
i thought was just gon+ na be me and rosa
and i even told rosa i was gon+ na get there at tennish
and and that's it
go in f_i_u
and picking up the thing
there's no traffic
was she there before you
no but susie was
no i'm' saying susie
susie was yeah when i got in the door was unlocked and how weird
but wasn't she supposed to be out
i thought everybody was gon+ na be out today
that's what i had heard that everybody was out
we made a lot of progress
all day
the morning was getting ready for the meeting
basically it was c_c's integrates
i gave her the ideas
modified them
she c_c_ed them
if that means complicated then yeah
you know these are meant to be for teacher assistants and they 're supposed to be non-threatening low-prep you know emphasizing
and i had told her you know do something on conservation because there's water
i 've given her
long story short it was very complicated so
i had already gone through them because supposedly that's what i was gon+ na do yesterday
so then in the morning i went through them i made copies of everything and then i also gave
for example one of the reviewers had recommended a book in the lesson of displacement where the water is displaced uh called the crow and the pitcher
mmhm
it's an aesop fable
aesop
aesop
a_e_s_o_p
aesop
it has an a
aesop's fables
a aesop
aesop's fable
you know the crow and the pitcher
anyway it has to do with a crow who wants to get uh drink some water from a pitcher
but his beak doesn't go inside
so he needs putting little stones in until the water rises enough he can drink it
and the thing is using your wit to get whatever
but it's a lesson on displacement which is exactly the second lesson
ruby used it
so i showed
and you went to work with those shoes
i thought i was alone
and did she say anything
they 're cute
they match my earrings
rosa said chancletas
no but she was talking to me about the other day
and i was like they call me hialeah when i wear chancletas
it's cute
it's a
like very cute
you know um rosa said that
uh did janet leave those shoes
and they said no i think they 're mum's why because they 're cute
so she's got her eye on them
which ones the ropy ones that are kind of high
yes
you know actually i bought them when i got them about a week ago i was gon+ na get them for her
and i got them
sunshine whatever your name is cat get out

i really thought it was them
yesterday with the vulture was disgusting
and you know everyone that comes the guy marco the guy from the satellite dish the guy from the thing they all step on my cactus garden
i'm' making i'm' starting to think either one of two things either i have to remove the the hose from there or remove my cactus garden

*herring9.csv*
the two piece set of the of the water glasses is
can you do me a favor
what
go to paypal
because i think that's a little bit more pressing more important right now than looking at some dollar store online
you know how to log in
you do it
give me the computer
ok
because this guy wanted to buy the lights to the car the headlights
and he he said he was gon+ na send the money in today
so if he does that's my to call him
at hot female dot com
oh yeah it's a it's a little gay that um that it's at hotmail dot com not hotfemale dot com
i'm' gon+ na i'm' gon+ na hotfemale dot com
eh eh eh
i bet it exists right
then let's make an account
don't you think that's funny
is that that french teacher's artwork
is it
i think so
i saw another one of his on the wall the other day in the other side of the library
i see
but why the hell does he put the fricking
and the ornaments
why does he have the table of the periodic table on
i don't know
that's ridiculous
ok no that he he didn't send the money
so i thought he wanted it today
check my email for me
let's see if he wrote to me or something
you know matt has actually asked me about the fish
what did he say
well he asked me how are your fish doing
and i told him that the puffer fish had died and
although that was a while back right
he hadn't asked me you know
yeah i know
and he said oh well there aren't those you you know brackish water
so he didn't the other guy had told him
and then i told him about the boxfish that we got
what did he say
that not to eat it
he said that those are the the they have poisonous swim bladder
oh uh we weren't gon+ na eat it
you wanted to sell it
yeah well but
ok
i don't think you 're
your book has shipped
what
you like colon cleanse
detoxify your body
no i don't want that
ok delete all of them except the ones from six gen maxima the ones from two books for you
baby so delete the other ones
don't do that
put delete all
oh oh oh right right
uh that's what i was planning
then take them out
don't make fun of me
and then that one again
and the amazon marketplace purchase no you got+ ta delete that
delete so everything else just leave those three things
yeah
right let me see the one for the two books
what's your tracking number
i don't think i got a tracking number
because i paid for the cheapest filling eh shipping
who cares
ok
so put it to save
no put it on the school
put it um move to move to school
to f_i_u
um
right here move to f_i_u
alright and then check the other ones for me
just click on it
ok
now someone show me
how we 're fixing please
i will do this good
because i have no way of
i'm' not gon+ na
where's the home
er it's a different person
it's a different guy asking
ok because i said
close it
because i somebody asking about how to wire the foglights in the car so that they come on on their own
delete it
yep
yeah clear them out
because jared jared says
maybe he doesn't know
because maybe he says he just pays for everything
maybe he doesn't know
but he says that his installer guy got the windows to go up and down with the remote with the alarm
i'm' thinking that the the installer just charged them for the for the modules
so maybe they'll' go up and down
and he doesn't know
what he's saying that it's without putting the the modules
i think that he's wrong
because
hey oh on the
yeah the because the thing is if if they have one
but but they charge him a hell of a lot of money
so it the he it probably is included in the price
alright
ok
he
he had to put it in this thing right
i can do it
i can do it with this ones too
so that means that there's a little connection that lets me do it with this key
you wan+ na rewire or
ok he says that the guy moved the connection from this receiver to this receiver
ok
how the hell can you move it from one receiver to the other
because there's a receiver in the car that receives signals from this remote
and then it turn it it makes the the the motors on the on the windows go down
he just unplugged that from that receiver
and plugged it into the auxiliary receiver on the on the module for this one
because i can plug in whatever i wan+ na it
mmhm
the point is i need to find the cables i wan+ na plug in
and plug it in to this thing ok
that's what he said the guy did
no everybody's like oh i don't know how to do this impossible it's difficult
not impossible that's doable
you know what you do is you buy the modules fifty bucks each
and they let you control
and then add it onto this
but then i would have to like run wires through each door
and so it's a pain in the ass to install too
besides the fact that it's you know the fifty bucks each
then installation is even more
so it's it's gon+ na be two hundred bucks
it's only let me see
ok let me go down
i thought they were gon+ na keep windows
i didn't know you could roll them back up
mine doesn't roll them back up
but i don't know if somebody says so
didn't jared say he could do that too
yeah that's what i'm' saying
i didn't think he 'd put a module
because i can't put it up and down
and my car just and the car just goes on
and you know what i noticed
if i had the car on it won't work anymore
yeah
the car has to be off for it to come now
ok
i guess it's not designed to work without a start with a remote start
do you wan+ na delete that
and then see what's in my junk
you need to see my junk
ok just delete it
yeah click on the arrow next to the junk too
there we go
isn't that just intuitive the arrow
whatever no i have a mine is better
ok you can log me out
good girl
go to hell bitch
why
let's go to wales
no
do you think they have lots of whales in wales
you 're the corniest person in the entire fricking
oh i i i'm' gon+ na ask him when he gets back
because i think it's funny
i think it's a funny name to call a country wales
what language do they speak over there
see if you know
welsh
no english
no
flemish i think it is
ok baby
i think it's flemish
ok darling
you know how many languages they got there
hello
is this another family guy reference
no that's from finding nemo
what she was speaking
does that sound a little orca to you
oh my god
ok
i went to all the websites today
i had so much i wanted to show you
yeah you did everything except what you were supposed to do
i know
well i'm' disappointed in you
as usual
and now the people in wales are gon+ na find out that i'm' disappointed on my fiance
ah
and they 're gon+ na think that the students from from f_i_u are not good students
well he he said to keep talking
but it doesn't say anywhere that we can't adjust the microphones
oh my god
anyways
you 're so annoying sometimes
um
oh yeah
i feel the same way you do about me
oh if we go over five thirty
oh oh she emailed me back
the lady from flamingo gardens
and what did she say
she said that we can have more than a hundred guests
but we 're gon+ na have to pay for their chairs
like bring in the chairs from an outside rental yeah because they only had a hundred chairs
so that was the only reason why they said me a maximum of a hundred for the for the fricking chairs
oh come on
that's not our problem
uh you what
i'm' just gon+ na leave the hundred chairs
and the kids can sit on their parents laps
or you know do whatever the hell
oh and um they don't close down the the park if you have a wedding
they it's uh still open to the public
i don't like that
i don't like that either
and if you 're in the wedding party you can't go you can't go roam around the park and look at things
unless you pay
unless you pay the twelve bucks
oh it makes sense
because you 're going for free but
well i'm' paying like two thousand bucks
so then we can't as a wedding party go together looking at things unless we all pay
no
unless everyone pays
that's another dozen hundred dollars
she said that she said that you can get the fifteen or more group discount
and it'll' cost you less money
that's so ridiculous over that amount of people
hey that's why she said twelve i think instead of
yeah but i i
because with the group discount you get like like twelve dollars for adults
versus seventeen it's a huge difference
it's over a hundred dollars less
but i don't wan+ na pay twelve hundred dollars for people to go look at birds
in my wedding yeah it's our wedding day
they gon+ na look at us
no no no i mean if they wan+ na walk around they can go on their own
and pay
i'm' not gon+ na yeah
well anyways i just
maybe because the last time we went it was right after the eragon
and it was all messed up
but i really
i think by now it should be fixed
we need to go back and see
look how pretty the gazebo looks
did you see it
the gays bo
oh my god
they 're gon+ na be like what the hell are you talking about
ah gays bo look it up

what the fuck
you know baby don't say bad words
temper temper mister j mister n_w_a
oh my god shut the fuck up
i'm' gon+ na walk away i swear
hello temper temper
you want me to walk away
hey you keep using bad words
no
anyways remember rebecca
no
that little girlfriend of mine from birmingham
from england
ok
that online girlfriend of mine
i think she either visited wales or she spoke
i'm' just thinking baby
comes to mind now
why can't uh can't that come to mind now
we were just talking to this guy from wales
and that maybe reminded me of her
i 've put it i typed it in right
i wonder if she settled

then they wanted to make money
so they started putting ads and stuff on it right
and then they 're like good now you have to pay to use it
so people stopped using it
yeah
well before they they make made you pay to use it while it was with the ads and all that stuff they come out with kazaa lite
some guy just hacked it and took out all the
yeah
two thousand five they closed down the network
because i think they got sued by the real wow

i said sued
because of the whole kazaa kazaa
they got they got sued
they got sued by the kazaa
the website's not working
flamingo gardens is you sure it's dot org not dot com dot com

who knows how many things you downloaded into your computer
no actually it says when you click on it it says kazaa has uh kazaa lite has always been free and if you paid for this you just been scammed
and no it doesn't have any spyware
it doesn't have anything

and it's very popular
look how beautiful the gazebo is for the ceremony
it's a nice gazebo
but
oh my god stop saying
wait ok
but what will happen in there
just you and me and the and the priest
uhhuh
and the officiant or whatever
that's it
that's the three of us and then
and everybody else is somewhere outside
uhhuh
where from outside around it or in front of it
in front
so a lot of people are not gon+ na see because of the of the wood
no it has a little it has a little entrance
right
and then you have the seats would be in front of it
where's the pen
baby i'm' just saying
if we 're all the way back here would
we 're not gon+ na be all the way back there
let me ask me my question
that's that's that's contorted babe
ok
well i never getting gotten married in case you can't tell
i mean if you haven't figured it out by now it's my first time getting married sweetheart
i mean wow yeah
oh my god
ok so this is the gazebo
so when is it that that the dog ate the the roger's dog ate the the parrot
they they didn't mean jim right
no they meant ok
they had this like neighbour who went out of town
uhhuh
and she left their her her parrot
in a cage or something like just
in yeah in her in her cage in the back yard
under like under their care
uhhuh
and mom said that she was outside the not this like this past week the the week before
mmhm
and the dog kept on jumping up on the cage jumping up on the cage and after the parrot
my mom got was trying my mom was getting annoyed right
i mean first of all she hates the dog
everyone hates the dog
except for roger
because
but what's wrong with the dog
the dog looks so friendly so happy
have you stepped outside
with that dog there
no but every time we come he's like jumping trying to play with us
he jumps up to your fricking face
nice
he could be a basketball player
and he he attacks
he he he's too he's too
how are you gon+ na tell me he attacks
he's he's he's like laughing and wagging the little stub for a tail that he has
yeah he he's having fun when he kills little animals and shit
oh
he's not a nice dog
roger has him trained for hunting
yeah but but you can train him for hunting and be nice to people
hunting animals not people
yeah well they haven't socialised him
because the girls are scared of him
he doesn't get wrong he doesn't get along with other dogs
he's just a little menace
like dennis
oh my god ok
i did not like that movie you know
it's it's based on a cartoon strip in a cartoon show
dennis the menace
it's better as a cartoon strip on a cartoon show
ok well
my mom went outside
and she sees the dog jumping on the thing
and trying to kill the trying to get to the parrot right
and mom says she grabbed him by the neck choked him and started like you know trying to
the dog
yeah
your mother
yes
isn't the dog bigger than your mother
no it's a little um
go on your mother i find it hilarious
that wasn't funny
ok so she was choking the fricking dog
ok so we talking about the midget dog not bo
not the big dog
no it's not bo
it's the the little white one
because they had too many animals right
i don't know what the hell it is
a little terrier or
no it's not a terrier
it's a it's it's an english dog actually
isn't that cool
ok god
it is
no it is
he said that it was
ok
uhhuh
my mom was choking
my mom says that dog is a freak of nature
because she was choking and choking and choking it nothing
the thing is that he would just keep on going like it's all good
so you had the the the
she got the manguera
but she had he had already eaten the the thing
started hitting him
no he was trying to
he she was trying
oh
he my mom got the manguera
started hitting him with the manguera
nothing
he just kept on going at the at the cage like it was all good nothing
hmm
he doesn't feel a thing
but why is your mother torturing this very expensive dog that her employers own
and then
because it was gon+ na it was trying to eat the parrot
yeah but it's not your it's not
and it turns out that he ate the parrot
but it's not your mother's responsibility to protect the parrot
yet is her her responsibility to not hurt the dog which cost a thousand something dollars
and it's roger's prize possession right now
my mom my mom was saying that she wishes that the dog would just die
which she's gon+ na get fired
because it's
that dog is not gon+ na die
unless roger shoots him or something
lassie let's go now outside
um
the the my mom said that they had to take him to the vet
and like they put like the the they give him i guess an enema
why
and pumped his stomach
why
because of the bones of the parrot inside of him
so what is roger gon+ na do
buy a new parrot
i guess
and and hope that she doesn't realise
no a she he's gon+ na have to tell her
why it's a fricking parrot
my killer dog ate your parrot
it's a parrot up it's a parrot it's a parrot
no but that that cage was huge
and it was a strong cage
the dog knocked the cage over
so what
and the thing opened
and the parrot came out
and the dog ate the parrot
so then he wasn't that that that strong if just
no no no no because the thing is it's
ok it's like the two part ones where you have the base
and then you have i guess a a cage on top which is um in i guess in the shape of a canopy
yeah no on the bottom it's open
so if you knock it off uhhuh so the the dog knocked it over
ah it's a stupid piece of crap then
and the parrot was not too bright
those parrots have their wings clipped most of the time
oh that's right they can't fly
yeah they can't fly
i was gon+ na say they can't swim
they flew they would 've they would 've gone
well that sucks
yeah
you know what i was thinking
my mom says that jock is probably next
my mom says that she no she said that she wishes that he would eat jock
because if he eats jock they'll' get rid of the dog
no but no
because they 're they all attached to jock
come on that's a beautiful freaking macaw man
they should they shouldn't let him
he should go
you know you tell roger he buys me a pellet gun and i i'll' shoot his dog
i'll' do the dirty job
he's not gon+ na get rid of it
he loves the dog
or he gives me his mercedes and i'll' run the dog over with his own car
so what do you think of the the gazebo
i don't even remember it
uh it's not a bad looking gazebo but
oh my god stop calling it that
ah i got+ ta exploit michael
ok
so yeah and then they have the rates yeah
if they can do the gazebo
and then the garden area
it says for use during ceremonies
that's what i wanted to use for the actual reception
i don't wan+ na use the barbecue pavilion
that's like retarded
after five thirty it pays seventy five dollars an hour
hmm
so then that means we 're gon+ na be done before five thirty with our wedding
our ceremony and everything
hopefully if you wan+ na
if not no
well well were you were you planning on paying extra per hour then
no i was planning on being done by then
so but what happened to the whole sunset and all that stuff
costs too much money
wait from five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty it'll' be like three hundred bucks
eight thirty for what babe
the sunset goes on around eight
no get it
when are we getting married
when are we getting married
in
daylight savings time or not
oh my god yeah
it'll' be like i wan+ na do it like february or march
so we'll' may be able to like just have to pay one hour extra
that's TRUE
and these people don't have anything about you can't use you know candles or you can't use you know uh the little sparklers
so you can do the sparkler thing
can we throw rice
no you can't
it's a bird park you get it
it's funny
yes it's a sanctuary yeah
so i'm' sure rice is off limits
the only thing that they they they have that they specifically say no to is the is the alcohol
well good we we i'm' sure if we just pass out drugs then people won't complain about not having alcohol
did they mention anything about drugs
no luke
ok so we can have drugs then
that's how we do it down here
so what do you think of flamingo gardens
i i don't know
we'll' have to see it again because i just
which is why
i think we should go with our families
no babe for that we can just just you and me
it counts for my class
it counts
i still don't see why we have to bring another twenty five people
i would like my parents to go
because they have never been to that park
and it's really lovely
yeah that's a whole different story
but it has nothing to do with me seeing it to consider whether or not i want it to be a venue for my wedding
yeah but we can kill two birds with one stone
and spend some time with the family
baby
ok that is messed up
and go look
we 're gon+ na a bird sanctuary to kill two birds with one stone
shut the fuck up
yeah oh now i remember what i was gon+ na ask you
do you think when they are listening to these recordings that they 're gon+ na listen to both of us at the same time
or is it just me just talking one crap and you 're talking a completely different crap individually
unless they put it together it doesn't really make much sense does it
think about it
think about it
if it's just you saying every so often shut the fuck up shut the fuck
yeah half a page of shut the fuck up
every so often
all on your own
without any input from me it sounds kind of weird
we don't need wedding counseling right or marriage counseling
no babe not yet we 're not married yet
we 're perfectly fine
we 're not married yet
that's one of the suggestions on one of those websites get to get counseling before you 're married
before
yeah
like if necessary
we should get a pre-nup
i'm' like what the fuck if you 're getting married you shouldn't be needing counselling
we should get a pre-nup
we 're not getting a pre-nup
yes we are
that's absurd
why babe
i wan+ na make sure when you leave me that i get ninety per cent of your money
we'll' make it that if you 're the one who makes it
uh oh yeah ninety per cent of zero
what is that
if you if no baby because you 're gon+ na make it big
if you make it big i get ninety per cent of your earnings
oh really
make it big in what
in history
sure maybe you'll' be the one to discover the you know jesus
stop no don't do that
why
sorry
maybe you
put it away
it scares me
maybe you'll' be the one to discover jesus
we could save so much money if we only had twenty guests
i know
my mom your mom
the ceremony for up to twenty guests two hundred and fifty dollars that's it
i i have i have to email them about the reception if we can meet them in the garden area in front
ray home verandah
you know what we should do it in
wait wait if this the ray home verandah says canopy of live oak surrounding the historic home
so would that imply that the that the thing would be outside the reception
ok that that sounds good
yeah babe but i don't think i don't think we 're gon+ na fit a bunch of people in there
that's a home
it's a house
no no no because i wanted outdoor
remember the whole tea thing i wanted to be outdoors
not indoors
yeah
i'm' just thinking all those birds and all those trees and a lot of pooping on our heads
we 're gon+ na have tents
i don't think we'll' need it
if they ok i'll' wear a white tuxedo there you go
because if they poop on my
you 're not wearing a tuxedo
i'm' not
i don't want you to
i want it to be really casual
all right
so like i was thinking a um a nice i dunno a tan suit or something like the tan
with a nice a the pink shirt or something really relaxed
now i'm' making all these and these concessions right
uh
what concession do i have to make
take it seriously
i am
i'm' taking it
no because of the whole religion thing
oh yeah no baby exactly
but that's why we 're not doing it by the church
yeah but we 're still doing we 're still having my uncle who's a pastor
who is gon+ na marry us
ok well make sure you tell him not to do all of that crazy you know voodoo bible stuff
they don't he doesn't the the christian church doesn't do the whole you know use the blood of christ and all that crap he's
i don't want any reading from the bible
i don't
i do want some
and
you said corinthians only
well
that's it
that's all i conceded to
because it's romantic
i don't want anything to do with god brought you here and god
because i don't believe in that
and so how am i
well you know what i i i need a little bit of of if he if he asks for a little bit of liberty in that for you to respect it
and well i suppose he's also gon+ na do it in spanish
i don't know
uh well considering
is the whole were you planning on the whole wedding being in spanish and not telling me until the day of
the the the invitations so far as i have imagined them are in english
but then i was thinking everyone in the fucking family speaks spanish
what the fuck are we gon+ na do
are we gon+ na are we gon+ na send everyone who speaks spanish an english invitation
well babe here's the thing
they 're in america
they need to get with the fricking program
i am not gon+ na do
luke
i am not gon+ na do two language invitations
because then you 're paying two different people two different companies to do
no because there's some people like
who
jessie and and and and davy
who got my fifteenth invitation in spanish and knew how to get there
you know if the the directions are in are in numbers
i mean it's not like you know uno dos tres cuatro
you know oh
no
does she mean one two three four
oh my god
are you gon+ na write well maybe because some of them they actually write the fricking numbers out
put the numbers in numbers
how about that
amore
no because i seen some of them that you know they write out the name the numbers
you know i i don't wan+ na do i didn't wan+ na do it in spanish
but it it makes more sense
being it's more it's more sensitive to our family situation
but then again are we doing this for
because i wanted to do that introduction on the top
are we gon+ na do this for our family or for us
well obviously it's not for us
are we are you and i getting married
or is the family getting a party thrown
i mean are we throwing a party for the fricking family or for you and me
you know i don't wan+ na do it in spanish
because i don't just don't like it
you like to say te amo
that's pretty much the only thing i'll' concede i i'll' i'll' give
just because you see it as special
i say i love you
and i mean it as passionately as you as you mean te amo
it doesn't have the same connotation you know
but but i don't i don't wan+ na do
this is the gazebo thing
look the layout
no no no no but it ok i'm' not gon+ na
the vows are something personal
no one else it doesn't matter if the whole fucking ceremony is in english
uh stop with the bad words
sorry i'm' i'm' i'm' gone somewhere
they 're gon+ na go assuming that all they teach us here is fricking bad words
because you said that nasty word which i don't say
oh you little
you said it several times already
and it's just it's inappropriate for a for a petite little lady like yourself
ok sweetheart
thank you
it's uncouth
and you are so refined
ok
my lady
it's not
and this will be like el camino
and then you have a little
you know there was there was a pick up truck called chevy chevrolet camino
we would set up the chairs
there's also one called nova
yeah i know
but nova you know supernova that's sounds like an english word
ok
ok
so this would be like the walkway
and then you have the different rows of the different rows of the chairs
where is it whoops
hold on
this thing fell
ok
i found this website that does the the fans right
the but like ok
there there are rectangular
why don't we just put like you know one fan at at the end of each row blowing down
no uh the the fans are the paper fans
i i know
but why don't we do an electric fan that'll' actually do it quickly
ok
they 're rectangular
ok traditionally what you do is that you give out um a program at the ceremony
uhhuh
that basically says our names the maid of honour the best man
and a a small little
from my personal experience that is what i 've used as a fan the program
i bend it
and i kind of fan myself with it
ok but when i'm' doing that
is that that's not our idea right
no
oh
ok
could we save money by putting the program onto the face of
this is what i'm' trying to tell you
ok go
they have them on on a couple websites where it's a a rectangular thick card stock paper fan
oh yeah
and then it has a cute little design on there
i know
little flowers and stuff
and you can put the actual program on it
and you has it has the program on it
that's cool man
so it's a it's like a little
what let's take it one step forward then once it's that over
can you have it
those cost more money
ah
this i can get like
yeah but if that's like a fricking piece of cardboard and a and a and a dental dam or whatever
yeah and it'll' also be about a dollar each
a dental thing ah what is it called
yeah and a whatever
the little stick
these are about a dollar each
yeah because it's got+ ta be thick stock
or whatever
the the the fans that open up
the they have these silk ones
they have paper ones
they have the little wooden ones all of them
silk is cool
the cheapest one is a dollar fifty each
in all the websites i 've looked at
which is why i wanted you to take me to that chinese store
but our but that dollar fifty would that allow you to put enough text to put the whole frigging thing
no
the whole program
it doesn't none of them allow you to put the program on it
wow
you would have to print it out separately and glue it on or something
cool
or we can do programs printed out and rolled up into little thingies
and then have the fans on top of it
because you have uh
i think it would be really mean of us to have an outdoor wedding and not be not offer fans
for the people
well that's why we do it during the cold season
so that and we tell everybody bring your own sweaters
oh because i wan+ na have a spring wedding
i don't wan+ na have a winter wedding
i don't wan+ na have a summer wedding
i like spring
well why don't we do it on a day of spring where the temperatures will be around seventy sixty five degrees
sixty five too cold
no not once you have all that crap that you 're gon+ na have on you babe
i'm' not getting a huge poofy dress luke
ok then we'll' move it up to seventy degrees
why don't we do it on a day that's seventy degrees out
there's some there'll' be a lot of old people
old people still can't handle it
can't handle what
the heat
the temperature it's not good for old people
seventy degrees is not good for old people what the hell is that
you wait wait till you 're old you know
they have the perfect temperature they need
how are there so many old people here in florida
isn't this like the the the golfing capital of the world or something for old farts to come
i'm' worried we can't anticipate whether or not it's gon+ na be seventy degrees or eighty degrees or ninety degrees
are you saying this because of your parents
no my parents don't even know about this idea
and no they 're not that old thank you
well they 're older than mine
oh my god
well sweetheart i like the idea
yeah and my my parents are older than yours
and yet my mom can do more than your mom can do
because your mom is in pain twenty four seven
well you know why
when my mom was your age was your mom's age my mom could do anything
you know why
because your mom's a vieja
no because my mother is a fully developed woman
your mother is a little midget with no meat on her bones
no meat on her bones
are you ignoring like two hundred pounds of meat or what
i don't know
because my mother has a body
she has butt
she has boobs
your mum is just she looks like a square
and a small square at that
a little stubby
my mom
yeah babe fifty years ago in her time maybe she was hot
now she's not
you know same thing about your dad
maybe a hundred years ago he was hot
but now he just looks like a freaking old you know
fuck you
like the crypt keeper
five years older than the crypt keeper
that's all that's the house by the way
and they have in the back supposedly
i haven't seen it
i remember
we saw it in person
but it was after the hurricane
yeah i know
so it looked like shit
we didn't go in we didn't go in
well the whole park was
they have tours
we can go take a tour of the house
the whole park was destroyed when we went
i really wan+ na go back
i really wanted to go back with my parents and the girls
that 'd be nice
have a little day out
and enjoy the park
then the uh uh
i i just don't even wan+ na look at it
the spanish monastery anymore
no it's just
i don't really wan+ na do it in the spanish monastery
i i i was disappointed when i went there
they 're they 're
they 're too uptight
and the place is so small and gloomy
they were too uptight
and then the whole place looks too small
it looks gloomy
it doesn't even look like a happy place
babe if you want a happy place we'll' get married in mcdonalds
come on
you got you ever gone to one of the little play thingies and been gloomy
it's beautiful
no babe
it's it's cheerful outside
and there was the other place what was it
i'm' gon+ na go to my email
let me find it
there he is um
the other place
it was that house in little havana

*sastre1.csv*
from what i know
mmhm
mmhm
it's beautiful
mmhm mmhm mmhm
and i set it up in the in the campground
yeah
it's not even
so that's something to
this is great back here
mmhm yeah
and this month that is pretty cool
it's really really nice
when it gets to july and august it gets hot
you got+ ta wait until almost the end of the day
that starts cooling off a little bit to be out here
at at at three thirty four o'clock it's fine
ah but thank god you don't have to worry about a pool
because pools are good for when you have smaller kids but already
they don't even wan+ na jump in it
eh we had a hard time finding the house
because we were looking for a house in miami lakes on the lake without the pool
and that's that made it very difficult in nineteen ninety eight when we bought here finding that
we couldn't find it
we couldn't find any house
most of the houses have pool
they all have pools
and then we came across this one
mmhm
and we got it pero
a house on the lake without a pool is almost impossible to find
but you 've done a lot to this house
mmhm yeah
you have done so much
it's incredible
yeah
yeah
eh we are gon+ na redo the bathroom
ah my idea originally was just to leave the tub
change
make it a shower
you don't like showers
no we are gon+ na put a tub a tub but a new tub
oh ok
because it's gon+ na be very hard to leave an old tub
and then match everything else to the old tub
so kind of a
we are gon+ na redo redo the whole thing
humidity
mmhm
mmhm
yeah
but it's fairly small
and when you get to the place you have to actually put it up
up
and and open it and put it together
the other one no
the other one everything is in place
you just get there
and press the button
press the
right
and
and everything opens up
my friend has an r_v
you don't even have mmhm
it's beautiful
oh my god it looks like a house
mmhm
mmhm
but it's big
you know
mmhm
and he takes it with him
i mean it's wow
he presses the button
mmhm
that whole thing like opens up
it's got a master bedroom
yeah
and a
mmhm
and two other bedrooms with a bathroom pretty big
mmhm
i mean it's really nice
mmhm
the kitchen is beautiful
yeah
yeah
flat screen tvs i mean he's got it
mmhm
yeah
because he likes to go to the keys a lot
yah the keys are getting very
expensive
right difficult expensive and difficult with
it's very hard to find a camping spot spot over there
space now
yeah because what they do is they build now on them instead of
right they close them
they close american outdoors they close a a bunch of them
yes because people are making money selling the property so
mmhm
yeah
they don't make as much renting as they do selling
yeah
and the campgrounds were beautiful places to build on
because they were huge pieces of property a lot of them right on the ocean on the water
so you know it was a good deal
yes
so they closed them
american outdoors was a beautiful place
and they just closed it down
mmhm
wow
mmhm
oh look at the little
cleopatra yeah
yeah that's
oh my god
when pepita moved to tampa she acquired the rabbit
is it a miniature
no
it's a dutch
no
i don't know something dutch
ay how pretty
mmhm
i have a friend of mine that has two miniature rabbits
yeah
he keep them he has them as pets
and they are little
mmhm
yeah
they don't grow much
and i have some another doctor over there that has a miniature pig
yeah
that's the daughter's pet
it's a pig
mmhm but the little ones the miniature ones
yeah
yeah
how cute
everybody has their own pet
mmhm
how is everything at the hospital
good
it's busy but it's good
mmhm
you know they have more work less people
yeah and less money
every yeah because you have to work double so
yeah
yeah yeah we 've been three years without a raise
because
i mean what we do is they give us like a raise i mean is it depends on how much you make
but basically what it does is then every year they put up the insurances so high
mmhm
that the little money that you are making it's they take it away with the insurance so really you are not seeing much
they take it away
it's just like there's no raise
you know
and i'm' the one that pays the insurance because my husband's insurance is much more expensive
that's it yeah
yeah because since i work for you know they have a lot more
yeah
so you know it's
mmhm
insurance is cheaper but still
i'm' not gon+ na have to carry her in my insurance anymore
yeah
because she'll' have her own insurance and for her working for the county the insurance is free
and for pepa is free
and i pay if it's just for me it's just like thirty dollars a month
no that's not bad
and isn't it better for you to go with her with the with the county no
no because if we go into the family plan her plan is more expensive than mine
oh i see
that's why i had it
i had the insurance under me for pepita
oh ok
and me because pepa had her own
but now that pepa has her own and pepita is gon+ na get her own then i can get mine on my own
it's thirty some dollars which is not a bad deal
but my brother my brother was telling me that that that law that came about with the homestead exemption
mmhm
that he was saying that you know that it's not worth it
he was telling me that so many people from the county are gon+ na lose jobs because of that
they are gon+ na take you know they are gon+ na cut the cut down is gon+ na be so drastic
and the people what they are gon+ na save for the homestead is so minimal that it wasn't worth it
and i said well
yeah
everybody is looking for a buck
no
in two thousand and three that the taxes were more or less what they are now
mmhm
right
that was five years ago
the salaries of of employees and the hiring of employees have not increased what they increased in revenues
so where is all that extra money that they made when the when the boom was going on
it was misspent
ah they bought things that maybe they didn't need to buy
they made
let's bring it back to where we are donde estamos ahora
hello
hey baby are you back
oh but i'm' not home
i'm' in the
ok

hmm
but don't wan+ na go in the street anymore

yeah
in the industry
mmhm
but it's just that you have to drive around so much

get the kid a good car when we ended up finding out when we had already paid everything for the car that car had been chocado de adelante completamente
mmhm
mmhm
so they fixed the car
and they sold it to us thinking that que no nada nada tenia el carro
when we went to trade in the car for the honda the guy told me that he couldn't take that car
and we say why can't you take this car
because that car is no good
mmhm
it's been crashed from the front
mmhm
and they put a special sticker when you open up the door of the car on the side right there
they put a sticker when a a a car has been crashed from the front
because of
yes
mmhm
and they wouldn't they wouldn't take the car for nothing

but then when you come into the lake that's miami lakes

you thought your mom was bad
this is a whole another level
no tosca knows how to do this too

i don't think that that's a big barrier
ah it was a two for one special
oh was a two for one
you guys just ate it down the stairs

i'm' telling you guys right now

and when is he and when are they coming back for him
i have no idea
i don't really care
he's only been here
honestly as long as
oh i was talking to chaquita
she ignores me
she that little boy has only been here for a month
so
a month
yeah
a month
a month
who who are you talking about
no i was talking about that little boy
no we 're talking about that little boy
oh i'm' like who
he came february second from cuba
that little boy pobrecito
so he came to like make little friends
yeah they just landed here
and already he's learned to play wii
they just landed
and they 're they 've been playing for an hour
yeah marco turns on the wii
and i go i don't think he knows how to play that
and marco goes of course he does
and i'm' like i taught him
yeah marco goes i taught him i taught him
and you see the little kid
although i'll' tell you marco's spanish is not that great
but that's good because
he really let it go
but i that's that's normal
but then on the other hand tosca's spanish is much better
she's also ambidextrous which is interesting
and then that's also the same thing that i think influences um she has a little bit of dyslexia
i wan+ na go down
i wan+ na go down
oh no
and i think it's all related
that's what i think
do you really think that it's dyslexia
i mean she's still in the learning phase
she's still in the learning stage
yeah but
i still i mean reverse numbers
no but like you tell her twenty and she'll' put zero two
mm
yeah
and and there's words and stuff that
and she's also fascinated with things that go backwards and forwards
like she'll' take a a piece of paper
she'll' do her homework
and then she'll' flip it over on the backside
and then everything that the way that it's runs through she'll' recopy it all backwards on the other side
she does it backwards
oh let me see your
ah they 're from last summer
they 're all
they 're from bakers
yes
i think they came out again because i saw them
no
yeah i saw them
i need them
i saw them
and i was like wood shoes for summer i love them
oh my god
yes
bring them up
what are they called
no they 're
i don't know what they 're called
i'll' show them to you right now
oh my god right now i need them
see i saw them
i saw
i was just talking
right now i need them
right now
you know what they would go great with
look because look how rat tattered they are
oh yes they need help
they would go great with the white dress que mi hija me regalo
oh my god
but you know what the problem
because i think white with
you know what the main problem with the shoes is
they 're too high
no
no what
they 're extraordinarily comfortable
but
first of all
and second of all they go with
oh so that's a problem
they go with my coach bag
oh i thought you said
oh i thought you said were gon+ na say they go with everything everything
they go with everything
they do though because that color's very universal
they do go with everything
but they most importantly i have a coach bag that matches
but don't you think
i just saw it
i saw it
i can't get rid of the shoes
but they have it they have it again i'm' telling you
i just saw it
but i have to get them
don't you think it'll' go pretty with that white dress
i think with white it'll' look gorgeous
oh my god for sure
oh my god for sure
it's very summery
i can't get into the whole white shoe thing
white shoe well i have the white shoes from nine west
well though that's really
and that's the only ones i have
yeah but that's an exception
those are the only ones i have
but other than that really white shoes are for viejas
no but not those
how dare you
no but not those
no those are very fancy-shmancy
those are spectacular
those are beyond fancy-shmancy
but i can't believe that
and he played it off
whatever i mean things are very sensitive right now at work
yeah that's super uncool for her to do that in front of everybody too
uncool on ten different levels
yeah
so
because even if it was it was kidding around or
and that's what i told him
i said why would she do that
that's completely tacky
very tacky
but whatever
you know what are you gon+ na do
so i go well you know we'll' keep it quiet
and what did he do
he freaked the fuck out
he freaked out
he played it off
he neither confirmed confirmed nor denied
and he just you know
he had a special box
he left it like that like oh well where did you get that from
and left it at that
now
oh my god
the you know so i i i talked to him about it
but he's so funny because a couple of people have told me that they see him mas mas embulladito
like remember this is
like just in general
yeah
this is a very quiet
hold on
lili you wan+ na go outside
this is a very quiet guy
oh no
you know
hold on marta's calling
he tried the spinach
he ate cucumbers
he wanted to try everything
that's good
he doesn't wan+ na have anything to do with the ranch dressing
i wonder why
no he didn't
that's what he did call it
ay how funny
and he will eat the vegetables with out it
the ranch is the most the taste the most pleasing
and to me the ranch is the best thing
how funny
yeah but remember
he called it la pasta
but remember they 're not
but remember
oh there's a new one
we 're supposed to watch it
oh i haven't seen it
anything that's out of the norm
yeah
because flavors all of that is completely foreign to him
yeah completely foreign
i told you
did you see that his father goes oh what what is that
asparagus
he's never seen asparagus before in his life
yeah he goes asparagus
i'm' like oh no those are two different animals
and he goes
i mean asparagus is a very distinct looking thing
you didn't hear what he said
you didn't hear what
he goes esa
what
i felt bad for it that he said that
at least he recognizes that it's TRUE
awful
the important thing is is that i think that they all came con los patines puestos
i don't know if you noticed
yeah
the only thing i feel bad because it's the second person already that has put me in that position
i feel really bad because the other day antonio calls me
and he was a doctor
and i go to antonio
i don't know
and no i'm' gon+ na tell antonio listen that's very cute he can take that diploma and shove it up his butt
because here it's worthless
here it's worth nothing
and antonio goes oh my god are you serious
i go yeah antonio
i go listen i'm' licensed in the state of florida
you have to start over
florida
i'm' not licensed anywhere else
if you move to another state you have to start
if i go to california i either have to take the test or hope that my scores are valid enough for that
yeah
take the test
yeah take the test
so i'm' not even talking about the country
i'm' talking about the frikking state
the state
come on
no you 're right
like i was like and then antonio se quedaba asi
he goes oh my god because what do you think in in the field of medical assistant
i go i'll' tell you right now look a medical assistant makes the minimum wage they work like a dog and everybody that came from cuba is a medical assistant and they all think that they 're doctors
it's yes it's an overpopulated field
it's really
i don't know like
and i feel really bad
because marta's asking me
and i'm' like er bueno marta er yeah
or you know
but i mean the way i see it is
i mean it's good that they have that that motivation
if that's what he wants to start with and continue more power to you
more power to him
but the
more power to you
and i told him
i go the biggest problem you 're gon+ na have is your english forget anything else the knowledge is there obviously
but did you notice how he's already uttering words
that's good though
i thought that was uh i'm' i'm' very impressed
yeah no no no that's very good
that's why i told him
i said you know right off the bat i could tell that you 're the kind of people that are gon+ na be successful wherever you go
you 're not
right
because
yeah and he's asking he even asked me to like
so
they are
they are very like what do i have to do
right
no he was even asking marta like como se dice
what do i have to do
where do i have to go
sign me up
yeah
yeah
they have they have interest
and not just some of them
but all of them
like you could tell that
and you could tell also that he's a modern man
like oh where's your wife oh no she's over there signing up for english classes
yeah
oh yeah that's great
who do you know that comes here a month later and signs up for english classes
nobody
for god sakes
not even young people
yeah
that she's been here since she's was twelve eight years later she has nothing to show for it whatsoever except a baby
yeah
oh whoopdedoo you know how to lay flat on your back
yeah you know how to open your legs
how about that
good
how about that
that's her special talent

dammit i didn't know that was a special talent
because if i would+ a thought that was a special talent i would+ a kept on doing it
america's most talented
i don't know
apparently that's a special talent
lili i don't know if i can
and the change in his personality and
oh my god lili we both can't walk over there to open the thing
oh no she wants to go out
ok i think we both have to walk over there
oh no
what do we do

just like that
so she can go in and out
oh there she goes
just like that
that's perfect
thank you
because now we 're trapped
look
and that's all it was about
oh because she wants to see what's going on
yeah
everybody's noticed that he's happier that he's more conversational
why because was he's a little bit
very quiet
but he was a little bit like serious before
very serious
very serious like intimidating serious
like one of my coworkers is still very like wow
but then when he stays quiet and he looks at me i wan+ na like go under the table
i don't know what's going on
i wan+ na hide
i wan+ na hide
i'm' scared
and then um and j_d makes fun of carlos
oh my god
and j_d imitates carlos
it's hilarious
well but to a certain degree i mean he has to kind of have that presence because of his position
oh my god
in his position and
i mean he can be part of a group
not just his position but let's let's talk
he's a writer for god's sakes
what do you mean he's a writer
he's written two books already
published
apparently not
oh
but like books about what like
but apparently
like like novel or
like i think like novels
really
i didn't know that shit
i i have not had the luxury of reading them
i would like to
so would i
just to see
he plays three instruments
i think you told me that
what are they
drums bass and guitar
very interesting
now i didn't factor in factor in twenty six years of law enforcement with rank at that
all the percussion percussion
hello i mean the guy has a hell of a resume
yeah yeah
yeah he has
right
and now and now you you know and now you add the forty five years
yeah
you know
and he pretty much he looks at people that way very
and
and
he's like donald's and you are
and you are and you 're here to see
right
and you 're lucky if he might even speak to you
oh my god
speaking of that you know the other day tommy and i well we didn't get into a fight or anything but he pretty much told me that i have to change my ways because i'm' so harsh and that i don't
uh oh
oh we visited this before
yeah but
and i i almost started crying and everything
because i was like but i don't understand how can you say that
i don't even realize that i'm' doing that
i think i'm' much harsher than you are though
but he says that i'm' harsh
and i thought but i don't realize that i'm' doing it
but when are you harsh
and i even told him give me an example so i can cut it out i mean i don't know but you don't even realize that you 're doing it and you don't realize the power of your eyes
uh huh
you know what you have to do
and i look at him
that's what it is
and i go the power
it's the facial expressions
you know when i was in the academy
and i go to him the power of my eyes
and he goes you could sit there and say hi how are you but your eyes are saying i don't know what
your eyes are saying something else
well i will tell you what
and i'm' like but i don't i mean i know when i make faces
when i was in the academy i used to get in trouble for that
for making faces
for making faces
because it didn't matter if i had learned to shut up
right and you were smiling yeah
because my face said it all
yeah
i would sit there and go
right
well that's
and then the instructor would go miss do you have a problem
and i 'd have to go
you know
no i didn't say anything
and it didn't matter what i was saying
because my face was saying something else
well that's what
well you don't realize
so anyways go back to the you he tends to look at people like that
and he does the same thing
he has this he has this poker face
i don't think that's a
is that a bad thing
i don't know
he has this poker face all the time
but he's definitely mastered the art of of being quiet and observing
well i think and i 've i mean i i do this because obviously i think tommy is much more quiet and observant
and i think people like that are
i don't wan+ na say that they 're smarter or more
i think they 're a better judge of character
it's a talent
it's a talent
it's enviable
it's um
i wan+ na learn
we can't
we 're too social
you know what it is
we can
but it's not in our nature
but we can
but um do you wan+ na
sometimes
it's something that i think i wan+ na i wan+ na do it
i like i like to be i like to be madam butterfly
remember that
no
remember
oh madame butterfly
madame butterfly
i wan+ na do it
i wan+ na
when and and you know what though
i think that in my job i have to center myself more than in your job
well yeah even though the other day i told the patient something
and i was like
as soon as i said it boy i was like not didn't do good
said it
you were like ah ah
but you know what
hey
i said it
what do you want me to tell you
oh no no
what was it
well it wasn't anything bad
like now
ay
i told you that right
so there's
you know we 've been getting a lot of viejitos
whatever cool
and you know how it is
so every time that she goes for therapy she'll' ask you a thousand and one questions
that's her social hour
that's her social hour
you know if you had one patient
but you have ten fifteen patients going at a time
i don't have the time
and no matter how much i really wan+ na sit there and answer her questions and not be rude i can't sit there and answer especially when they 're just redundant questions
reminds me of something
go ahead
when they 're just oh my god is she really asking me this
we 've already told you this mind you
i forgot her name
oh my god
but do you feel bad are you having an emergency what's going on
but they can't stand the limitations
right
i told her that
you 're not supposed to feel good at this point
whatever
she starts giving this whole thing
she wants to see the progress
yeah yeah
no and then she tells me
and they did x-rays
you know how they normally give you like the sheet which the guy the doctor actually has to interpret and say we found a fracture we found this or whatever
so look i go for your
i mean she can get it
it's her personal records
and i go ok for your records no because i have a a friend who's a doctor in cuba aqui no es nada pero es un doctor en cuba
and he's gon+ na tell me what i have to do
and he wants to look at them
because that just riles me up
like there is no
why does that even bother me though
it bothers me
it bothers me
so of course i i did the whole
i go ok the doctor that saw you here is a board certified orthopedic in the state of florida not in cuba here here and he didn't tell you that i don't understand is it that you wan+ na be operated i mean is that
in cuba
probably
yeah
i no i asked her
and you would think that's a last resort
that that's something that somebody would wan+ na avoid
no
no
and ah and so you know
yeah it's the it's the last resort
they 're gon+ na do all the conservative treatment
let's do pills
until
right
let's do this
it's the last thing
the last thing they wan+ na do is cut you open
ok
no especially when it comes to things like that
it's probably
because that's
yeah and we 're not talking a thirty year old woman
we 're talking an eighty year old woman
you 're not removing a tumor
you 're talking about things that are more sensitive where you have the probability que no va a quedar bien
yeah
so i told her that
and i told her
and i said that's where i pass the line
right
yeah who do you prefer
i go no i understand that i understand that and i respect that but you have to understand too bueno para que fue eso
and i was like oh shoot
i shouldn't have said that
because it's not my clinic
it's not my
but you know it's like listen
yeah but the ignorance the ignorance is unbarable
that it that really riles me
that really riles me
the ignorance is unbarable
and you know she's an older but she's an older lady
so what can you expect
so tell me about the old tell me about the old guy
mm
so yeah so a lot of people have noticed
and even we went to have breakfast at a place where we usually eat breakfast by ourselves
but like
you and the team
me and the team
but he wanted to join us
oh my god he wants to be buddies with the guys
well i think
he's a smart guy
you know why he's doing that
no he is
but you know why he's doing that
no he is he's doing the like the dog
you know why he's doing that
no but not only that
not only that
he's marking the territory
but not only that
i can't beat them
i mean not that they have anything where
so i'm' gon+ na join them
i'm' gon+ na join it
i'm' gon+ na let them know that i'm' one of them
i'm' gon+ na let them know that i'm' their friend
and that everything's good
and they 're gon+ na take care of her for me
yeah they 're taking care of
because they like me
right
and i'm' the daddy
mmhm yeah he's very smart
and i'm' the daddy
i'm' the daddy
no he's very he's brilliant he's beyond brilliant
that's funny
ok so you go to have breakfast
yeah let me tell you
and the waitress takes it off
he suites me
i mean
how do you know that
no
she couldn't even take our order right
oh my
i 've never seen her that enthralled by someone
that excited
that excited
oh excited with
yeah
she probably thought you were kidding
i came back in the afternoon
she probably thought you were kidding
no it took me like twenty minutes to convince her
she probably thought you were kidding
let me rewind
no no wait
start the story from the beginning
ok so we get to breakfast
she can't even take the order
make us a coffee
they were they were screaming
and they were like my god what is wrong with this woman
they were embarrassed for her
they were like we 've never seen you like this
and i was like oh my god you 're not kidding this woman has a crush on you
oh my god
and he told me
because he had been there before
and he had sensed it
we go there all the time
sergio's
yeah but him him
yeah he goes there all the time
we go there all the time
everybody goes there ok
everybody goes there all the time
that's the hangout
so he had kinda sensed it
and he was like oh my god
but she's like an older lady
yeah well she's about his age
his age
ok but she's cuban
yeah
and she looks not great
she's no she's columbian or something
i'm' like
ok but she doesn't look great
she looks like she looks like her age or probably even more
she looks her age or maybe a little more
ok yeah
yeah yeah
and it's so funny
because he tells me
he goes oh because you look twenty
he goes he goes you don't look thirty five you look more like twenty five
you know
and he goes he goes oh and there when we must go out people look people stare at you and they must wonder what is that girl doing with that viejo
he must be loaded
he must be loaded
that's the sugar daddy
because you know i say that too
when i see like a young girl or a younger girl with a guy
yeah but i don't think he looks that much older than i yeah
no i know but
and i don't
and i guess at the end of the day i don't realize that i i really don't look my age
but
yeah that's the thing
you don't realize you think no i'm' thirty-five i'm' fine with it whatever
i think i'm' fine
yeah
you think that everybody because you know me and we all look the same
in my age group
right
we all look the same
but when you meet
because i know it happens to you
right
i did an evaluation on a man
uhuh
and you know over there they just don't got the nutrients and stuff right
so they don't look good
so i'm' evaluating this man
mind you i i just get his name and his diagnosis
i'm' not looking at his age
fractured wrist
i start talking to him
still not looking at his age
mmhm
i did everything i could to him
mmhm
and you 're thinking he's in his forties
after
i'm' thinking he's pushing fifty
yeah
after he leaves i go to write his paperwork
he's thirty
born in nineteen seventy two
yeah
and i go like this oh my god
yeah
and roger's behind me
and i go oh my god
and roger goes what happened
and i go roger did you see that gentleman that just left
a new guy
and he goes yeah
i go guess what year he was born
roger was born in nineteen seventy
and he goes i don't know
i go seventy two
he goes oh my god that man's like my that man's my dad's age
oh my god
i go i know right
i go are we totally like our our perception is out there because you know we think that we 're cool we 're young and hip
no as far as i'm' concerned i'm' cool and hip
because everybody that you know that's your age more or less fits the bill i think
i don't know but
so when you see someone it's like short
but i mean think of it
does that happen to you with the shortness
like i i know that i'm' short
but i don't realize it until until either i'm' standing next to someone very tall or i see someone very short
i i think i'm' big
like the other day i was in publix
and i i just cracked myself up
i was there pushing my little cart
and from a distance there was a
she must have been philapino or something
the lady was like this tiny
yes i saw one in the mall yesterday
she was like this tiny
yes
and i'm' as i'm' pushing the cart
mind you she's far away
and i go short
she's very short
and i'm' doing the whole to myself
yeah yeah yeah
as soon as i walked by her she was still shorter than me
but couple of inches
but not that much
mmhm
and i thought oh my god is that what i look like pushing the frikking publix cart
because i don't feel that that's what i look like
i feel that i'm' walking around very tall and proud
well i think i'm' tall until kathy comes over
right mm yeah
she's eleven
yeah
and then you go
yeah
yup
and you 're taller than
right
yeah
right
and and i really i do think i'm' i'm' big
and it's funny
because people at work think i'm' big too
well because i think either they know you already
they don't associate
that's something that somebody somebody used to tell me all the time
or your personality
whenever and and as a matter of fact i get that comment a lot
and then and i even get it from frank
and frank's only like five eight five nine
he's five eight five nine
yeah
maybe no maybe he's maybe he's like between five nine and five ten
a little smaller
yeah he's not
no
he's average
normal
yeah he's normal
but for me that's super tall
yeah for
because
well not really
jeff was six something
four
but even when i put on my big six inch heals i'm' still only five six
that was extreme too
so he's five ten so i'm' good
yeah it doesn't
no it's still good right
but it's funny how people who know me and even people who know me who see me every day now that he gets to stand up close to me and put his arms around me and he says things like wow you 're really tiny
and i'm' like yeah you know i'm' only five feet tall
right
and he's like oh my god
he's like in shock
and i don't wear heels to work anymore
i wear sneakers
yeah
but i think it's
your presence
i think it's attitude
it's presence
yeah
your presence
people think people think you 're taller
yeah
but
right
you 're short
and i think it has to do with if you 're used to seeing someone in carino
i think
it's like um
i think i'm' i swear i'm' big
it's kind of like with andrew
i know andrew's huge
but i 've known him for so long
it doesn't shock me anymore
it doesn't surprise me anymore
mmhm
it's normal
it's
yeah me either
you know what i mean
yeah it's
it's almost kinda like it's normal
now if someone points it out to you
you go oh yeah yeah
ah whatever
mmhm
or maybe you see someone out in the street
and maybe they 're not even as fat as him
and you go oh my god that person's huge
oh my god that person's huge
you 're right
why is that
i think it's just you get used to it
wow you 're right
right
no you 're right
because you see andrew
and you know he's a big guy
no but you 're right
but you you you get over it really quick
but you 're used to it
yeah
he's a big guy
you just say he's a big guy
he's a big guy
yeah you get over it
and then you see some really fat guy
and you go wow that guy's fat
oh wow that guy's huge
and then you sit there and go
oh
but no
well
so oh my god
mm
so let's go back
i don't know if the story
but i'm' gon+ na say it anyways
ok
i think i told you that tommy's friend that really tall guy
the awkwardly
that well
is he a gringo
well he's not gringo
no he's not
he just looks gringo
he's
right
he saw jana
and he was all about
and he bought her the coach thing
yes
ok
so we went to the heat game
and the whole thing right
ok very good
then a couple of days later
what does he do again
he
no
by no means
he's eating a cable
mmhm
like j_d says
yeah yeah
yeah he's eating he's in the cable
he's in the
he's in the cable
why would he buy her such a gift then
it was ten dollars
i mean it normally runs like twenty or thirty
but he i guess he went to see all of it
it's still a cute little gift
ok
i mean it was it was a very cute sign
that is cute
it was very cute ok
so this is the thing
so about a week after the heat game whatever he calls up tommy hey i'm' gon+ na do a barbecue in my house so everyone can come over and hang out
mmhm
and tommy
what does she say about him
does she like
so tommy goes ok yeah we'll' be there
so tommy hangs up the phone and tells me oh my god this guy's gon+ na do a barbecue at his house
and i go ok so what's the problem
tommy has been to his house one or two times previously when the guy was still married mind you
mmhm
oh i remember this situation
that the house was super tiny
that they don't clean up
and it was really piggy
right it was really piggy whatever
so tommy tells me oh my god this guy's gon+ na do a barbecue
i'm' not gon+ na tell him no
what am i gon+ na tell him
is he living alone now
he's living alone but in the same house
because it was it's his dad's house
so the chick left
with the kids
right
where did they go
he has the kids
i don't know where she went
but whatever
so anyway
no she's hispanic
she's hispanic
oh
so he isn't
why do i think that he's un gringo
he's cuban
he's cuban
he's cuban
he's cuban
he's just blond and blue eyed
ok
or green eyes
so anyways
so tommy says oh my god i'm' not gon+ na tell him
you know
i can't go to your house because you 're a pig or whatever
and i 'd much less eat there
so
yeah yeah listen
oh my god

it was a house
it was a normal house at one point in time
and it's owned by this guy's dad

so this guy lives on like this side of the house
and it's like this
oh my god

ok what dog is that
it's that mutt
it's a mutt that's a mix between a boston terrier and a

and why would she bring it
exactly
so i do this
i do this
and i tell her
isn't it her first time visiting his home

and she's never been to his house
she's never been to his house

right
exactly
so i get there
we go to the backyard
the guy's cooking up the barbecue

mmhm
the dog brings the little ball the little bone
it wants to do this
mmhm
it wants to do that
and i'm' like listen get away from me

*sastre11.csv*
she has the bachelor
but it has to be a masters
yeah
but i'm' gon+ na finish school
she's gon+ na start school
and then i think i'm' gon+ na either go to law school
i have three options right now
and i'm' so undecided
i don't know
i'm' either gon+ na do law school my m_b_a
or i'm' gon+ na do a doctorate in my field because i have the masters done in my field
i did a bachelors in computer sciences and in management information systems which was from the school of business
my master now it's in management is a master of science in management information systems
that's what i did
mmhm
but the problem is they require a residency that you go do research with them
that's the problem
i like it
and that's the thing
if you like something it's easy
oh yeah yeah it's easy for you
no
everything is there
they painted
laid tile
put the baseboards
and put all the muebles
yeah the whole thing ya esta puesto
no i closed march third or march fourth
and we had bought everything
so we had all the delivery set up
but i had to get the tile laid
so they finished tile last week
the and then her grandfather painted
her grandfather started painting right after that
and he's almost done
and then we started to installing the furniture friday
friday they started to deliver it
but friday we had a big day like six people did deliveries
so i was like one after the other
yeah none of the the electronics are in
and we still have to do
we have this guy
i don't know if you 've noticed
but there's in my mom's house there's this ceiling
that's all wood
and the guy who made that
he made it from scratch by hand the whole thing
is this brazilian guy that's a woodworker
he and and he's just gifted
that's what he does
yeah
and he does all the stuff
so he's building the closet
and he built
they wanted to charge us like fifteen thousands dollars to do one of these closets that's very modular
and everything's super organized
and he's it's the same
when you gon+ na see oliver's
ok
oliver's closet
it's awesome
he's a contractor that has done he did my grandmother stuff
he did my mom's stuff
we just use he use we use him on everything because the guy is super responsible you know like we are
and and he does his stuff
and and he knows his stuff
he got us the tile guy because the tile guy was expensive
they came out perfect
they came out perfect
they came up beautiful they came up beautiful
so
they did it in a week
they did it in a week
they did the whole tile in a week
and they just went
and they finished it in a week
i couldn't believe it
they laid the tile perfect
perfect perfect perfect
that it's beautiful
but when when you go to the balcony you see that they really looked at it from end to end and they laid everything so in line
you know really really nice very very clean
you know what i mean
it's awesome
and it's on the twenty-seventh floor
so you 're like everything's right there
when what we see like if you drew a line straight out it would be the hard rock in bay side
that's like a line straight off from our balcony
because the building is at an angle
so if you say that this is we look like this
ok this is the building
we 're on this side
um
so we look like towards
the other side of the building looks like up the
yeah
you know what i mean
like up towards north miami beach
it really is
it's very small
it's very small
small
very very small
it has two bedrooms
it has like a library like a den which is our office where we 're putting the the sofa bed and we 're putting the computers and that stuff
and then it has the living room the kitchen the the two bathrooms and the entry way and the balcony
that's it
yeah
it's not a lot of space
it's about thirty hundred and fifty square feets
so when you think about that that's a lot of space
mmhm
no and we didn't know oliver was coming when we made the commitment
when we put the deposit we didn't know oliver was coming
right
well
so we 're super happy you know
with her we 're fine
just with one more fine
and and move or rent in a house or something i guess you know
you figure it out
you always figure it out
everybody's screwed
it's like musical chairs and who's gon+ na get stuck without the chair
you know then when the music stop
who's screwed
oh my god
may i
foreclosure
get outta here
my grandmother sold at a perfect time
the perfect
the perfect time
if she would not have sold that the pressure everybody would be under right now the stress that everybody would be carrying
no thank god thank god he has a great job now
thank god she found her place
and she's all set up
yeah
everybody is squared away
because if they would+ a stayed with the house holy shit
but the city the municipalities are all gon+ na come up short on their budgets
they 're not gon+ na be able to make it because who's how are they 're gon+ na do it
that's never gon+ na happen
in the history of man people don't go down not if they can help it
no and in miami two hundred thousand dollars
to know go buy a house
five hundred thousand dollars
you got+ ta make tremendous money
three hundred thousand dollars now actually you can get a decent house for
yeah
they told me
the you know what though
the danger is how much it comes down to
but the fact is if he even comes close to that what you guys have if you guys can get a comp now at that price this neighbourhood is gon+ na stay great
that's a heck of a selling price
that was a home run
that was a grand slam
that one at bat
and that's how it is
that's how it is
look at that
that's
no no no that's a great feeling
that's a great feeling
no way no
men
she's interesting
yeah
she has her days
she has
she's all over the place
you see everything
you see everything
it's like the rainbow
you see everything
she's so amazing though
she's so amazing
if i can do anything in the world right now i would take care of her all the time
that's what i would do
if i had if i had a million dollars
ten more years in my business and i'll' be able to step back a lot more
but
yeah
we 're at five years
we 're at five years
and it's a we did almost two millions dollars in sales last year
and that's of selling labor
of our hours
like we charge a hundred and seventy five an hour more less
and this year we'll' probably sell like two and a half millions
wow
yeah it's amazing
we are like at the highest level
of partnership with microsoft
we 're microsoft gold manage partners
mm
and they give us a lot of the customers now
and they give us money to do marketing
and they give us money to do events and host things and all sort of stuff
so that's really it
we do a lot of microsoft cisco and two other companies that also are really high in technology
and we do all sorts of customers
we have like thirty car dealerships
we had a lot of real estate customers that have all died
all the developers are almost out of business
we we had seventeen i think we have like two left
yeah
it's incredible
that whole market that whole vertical has just gone
uhuh
no and and it's not cheap
and and there's not people buying houses and flipping houses and building houses
so even though that it's a great opportunity to make money there it's not there
you 're right
it's invisible
you know
and they show you how to penny pinch
yeah you you take you stretch out the cleaning
instead of this and all the stuff
and before you know it you you save three or four hundred dollars a month that if you put into something you are saving money
mmhm
and saving money is the hardest thing to do
that's the hardest thing to do because there's no extra there is never extra
mmhm i'm' sorry
the sunday herald today had a big section on how the price of food is going up exponentially
here and around the world because oats and wheat have through the roof
oh yeah uhuh
they 're
and the other thing that's gone really high is corn because people are now using it to make the gas the ethanol
right
so a lot of people are buying corn so it's creating competition and demand and all these areas that are driving
mm
i know
like every time their cost goes up like like by a dollar on the on the market the cost of our cereal goes up by a penny
yeah
and that'll' jump twenty dollars and boom
they have to raise it twenty cents on the cost
the milk
no no no and now everybody is buying organic
so that's like six dollars
they they get you
mmhm
ah the grid you 're contributing power into the grid
all day
and your and your meter is basically rolling backward and you 're getting charged credited
and then at night it uses electricity
right
so now farmers are building fields
they look just like that but they 're fields of solar panel
and they collect energy all day
right
and they sell that energy back to this grid because the government is the one that has is paying a subsidy
right
for any body
the that wants to do it
and that is saving so much energy energy production that that's less coal less oil less you know natural gas less whatever
they have to do something about it because you know eh
no this is crazy
it's crazy yeah
this crazy er
and now you have china and all these other countries that are exploding with growth
yeah
and they 're where we were fifty years ago
so they 're gon+ na start expending and burning and using so much
that we have to switch
because if not we 're gon+ na get pulled back for them to move forward
there's interesting things that i 've i 've read about you know how everything
it's a there's a book called it's a flat world that talks about how the whole world is now because of the way technology and everything is we 're all in a little village
and what one person does affects the other one
and everybody's got+ ta realize we have such direct impact
we 're not often little islands anymore
it's not like that
even if you 're you know ninety miles it's nothing
a hundred miles you know a hundred thousands miles you know
it's a
uhuh
so i have everybody's information in there
then i have all my email
in my email when you call my cellular phone and you leave a voice mail right it records a computer file that puts that into my email
right and then i listen to all my voice mail on my email
so i sit down once a week or whatever
just grab all my email that are voice mail
and i listen to them
or my faxes
the faxes all come in when you send it you hear the number
it's sounds like a regular fax machine
and puts it in my email
and it's a p_d_f
and then i can look in the faxes
so everything's right there
everything's in my phone
i can look at the p_d_f on my phone
i can look at the fax on my phone any time
i can listen to the voice mail because the email's on the phone
the email's on the phone
you know how
you use microsoft outlook at work
yeah
you know how you have the tasks
like the to dos
those synchronize on my phone
and on my phone i have the tasks synchronized with the computer of the office
so wherever i am it's the tasks
all that stuff as you tie it together it
you know i remember when everybody used to remember all the telephone numbers
i know
right
yeah i know
but that stuff now is in that little device
but now you look at mary's
the iphone
it has a camera that is full of megapixels
when we went to the island i bought a camera for like a thousand dollars that was great
a sony camera several years ago
the camera in her phone now is better than that one
the camera in her phone it's a higher megapixel and better quality camera than that one was
and it's this big
it's microscopic
it's a speakerphone
it has the the ipod it's in the phone
so she has eight gigabytes of music which is at least a few hundred songs maybe a few thousands songs
no no no i haven't i haven't even started
it has a g_p_s with a map software
so when you drive it'll' tell you where to go
it'll' actually talk to you
and tell you make a left here make a right here
you can go buy stock
they sell stock on the phone
through the same thing that is a mary trader or any of these places where you do it from your computer
the internet on the telephone is so incredible
yeah
so they develop the technology that ah
i'll' have to show you this on the phone
then when you look at the web page tu coges tus dedos
and if you do this it zooms you out
and you can move around the page
so you zoom in
and if you touch like the link like on the internet if you touch the hyperlink te entra
it's incredible
it's so natural
to use it's so easy
like it's intuitive
and that's what makes apple different
all of the apple products are very natural
they 're very intuitive
they
i'm' a microsoft company
i know what microsoft does
it's great for business
but for just being easy to use and enjoyable man the apple stuff
mm
it's amazing it's amazing
it's amazing
so you actually see the website
and then you hit to the the arrow on the keyboard
so you can see everything like if you were flipping through a catalogue you 're seeing already the front of the web page
so when you 're looking for something if you can see the visuals
oh that's exactly what i'm' looking for boom and you 're there
so instead of presenting it to you in a word list of all of the blue links with all the words and all that stuff it's giving you the website
but on the bottom if you still wan+ na see the words you press button
and you can scroll through the box on the bottom
it's searchme dot com and it's really really good
yeah they 're testing they 're testing
and it's an interesting engine
that's the question
is will the engine of what they bring back when you type a word in be as advanced in the algorithm as google is
if it is then you have something really unique
because that's what it's a visual component with a very powerful search engine
google is a very powerful search engine
it gives you good returns like when you put something in it gets close to what you 're looking for
it is a good process
and think about it
their software google
it's a software
uhuh
that it's a giant company right
hundreds of billions of dollars
but their software scans the entire internet
every day
no they 're trying to buy yahoo
who's google's biggest competitor
but the yahoo owners the board of directors that runs the company says it's too little money
they offered forty two billion
they said it's too little
they said no for forty two billion
yeah
you 're talking about a company that didn't exist ten years ago
and then forty two billion's too little
and that's it
yeah i know know and microsoft's good
microsoft knows how to win
and specially when microsoft's coming in second place they know how to jump and beat the guy in first place
they 're not very good at being in the first place from the beginning
apple is very good at being in first place at the beginning
apple is really really interesting
yeah yeah yeah
that those computers used to be able to process like twelve million instructions per second right
these are gigahertz computers
these can do like four billion instructions per second
and when anything can calculate that fast
you know
i can't think what it can calculate
you know
oh my god
i know i know
so i took it over there
and they fixed it right away
and they are people that i'm' doing business with too
and they 're they 're a toshiba repair shop
and they fix like
they 're one of the only laptop repair shops in all of miami
and they have i_b_m like
yeah
we'll' take it over there
and get that fixed because the problem with my dad is that buying a new computer for him is is crazy because he's not gon+ na use
ok
he does very very simple things
and yeah my dad is doing very simple things
some picture thing
you know stuff like that
it's not a
you know the heavy duty
i'm' trying to think what else he can really really enjoy that he would like
mm
there's you know i'm' trying to think like in terms of electronics
there's some cool electronics
you know
yeah
yeah next week
uhuh
there's some really really really nice digital cameras that they 've come out with now
yeah i know
there's these are like the old school ones
the single lens reflex
but they 're digital now
like that really high quality
the other thing is there's nice digital video cameras now
very very fancy video cameras
so what else do we have
we have
there's always accessories
there's software to do different things
there's
home theatre
would he like this stuff
there's the flat screen televisions
which are really nice
oh yeah
aren't they great
yeah
they have no glare
there's no reflexion on the glass
you just
nice
what else
what else what else what else
no it's more than what he needs
it's more than what he needs absolutely
uhuh
yeah the power port on the on the motherboard's coming loose more than anything because that particular port takes a lot of abuse takes a lot of abuse
mm
so

and then i think on thursday she goes to arizona
so
she's travelling
she travels a lot
last time she came back so sick
ah just with tremendous flu that she got down there
and just really really sick
and that's the thing
when you 're out there there's no medicine
it's not like being here
i know
you know
it's not like being here
it's different
you got+ ta get back here
nobody has to pretend
this is the best there is
it's it's it's a disaster
but it's still still pretty amazing
oh my god
we 're gon+ na have a black president
and not only that we 're gon+ na have a a total change in everything
taxes are gon+ na go up like crazy
oh my god taxes are gon+ na go up so much
it's gon+ na get insane

that's insane
ok
no no no no she's a shark

oh my gosh
she's the one that knows what she's doing
he was just there for the ride
and he's just a great talker
man he's charismatic
he's very charismatic
he is
and he's a natural speaker
and he's got a gift to connect with people
but he's a tremendous party animal
and a bullshitter
and he's someone that
he's a politician when whenever he had to make a decision he 'd look around and then he 'd say no if you do that they 're gon+ na kick your ass if you do that
so he just did whatever the easy thing was
but sometimes you got+ ta do some fucked up shit
uhuh
you know what he does know what he's doing
and he's a smart politician
he's a politician of politicians
he knows how to work everybody
and that's it
you want somebody that can work the whole field the left the right the middle everybody
he's a TRUE politician you know
and he understands if he just says everything right there out there you know his bus is called the straight talk express
because that's what he says
when i talk to you it's straight talk
i'm' talking to you straight
that's right
there's nothing hidden over here
there's none of that
i'm' telling you what i think
you might like it
you might not
you might hit me
but that's what i think
mmhm
the other ones are like you know i'll' think this if you want me to think that

he goes i wasn't here a minute ago you know when you came by
yeah
i said the computer was on i thought it was you
he goes i could have sworn i shut it off
i said it was on when i got here i didn't do it
maybe they were working on it
yeah maybe the guy
like they were doing yours
well because he's been having problems with his
yeah
so they probably worked on it
so hopefully
yeah they tried to fix it
and i go my computer's working so i guess i'm' gon+ na go ahead and go back i'm' gon+ na answer emails input all the new purchases that we just did into my spreadsheet because i was able to get everything
like it wasn't the hard drive
all right
it was the memory
oh yeah they they needed to put more
so
right so i just went ahead
and um i did all of that
and then i was sitting there
martha was telling me
and it's what it is
even though i i tu sabes
yeah
so i don't get any of her things
i guess it's a little bit of that
oh that's probably what it is
beautiful girl
she doesn't look eighteen
she looks older
she goes gracias
i'm' like ok
yeah you wish it
she goes
she goes that's me
ginny
uhuh
and how
she goes like we think it's cancer
he's still in the hospital
no he's out
he's been out
but he can't sleep
they have to give him valium to sleep
really
how weird
wow
so for a whole hour she sat there with him while they did the m_r_i
ah
the doctor still called him
and told them that he thinks it's cancer
oh really
yeah
wow
so
that's horrible
hi baby
you 're awake
how you feeling
ok
go in
in there
huh
we can talk
you can't
go away
that's horrible
you know she tried calling
how old is he
is he young
thirty seven
wow
but she says you know she called the guy
and the guy told her
i guess like they saw her with him
right
because they are not really
laws says you are not supposed to
yeah
right
but like they know she's the step-mom
and she is the one that actually goes in because like i guess the mom's a scaredy-cat
so she's the one that goes in with him
you know her name is not lucy
but ok
lucy
and that's that's her daughter's name
ok
go figure
so
what's her name
martha
unless lucy's her middle name
yeah middle middle name
and she he she goes so i did what i like to do for a whole hour
she goes afterwards
it was because for a whole hour she was sitting there talking to him while they were doing the m_r_i
aw
was normal
she goes so it's not looking in it's not this
right
yeah
she goes but apparently they think
she gave them the cell phone the work number you know
apparently he ended up calling her
oh really
he the guy er her stepson called her
and said um and said that the doctor had called him
and he she goes he told you
she goes yeah
she goes i really tried for them not to tell you i wanted to be the one to
mmhm
and she goes but you know what that doesn't mean it's TRUE tomorrow when we go to the biopsy that's the one that's for real
yeah
yeah
you know tomorrow for the biopsy that's the one that really counts
oh my god
but apparently he doesn't want his mom and dad to know
i guess not yet
right
so um so she's like don't worry i won't tell them you know so if you don't wan+ na tell them i won't say anything either
so i i was like you
i did what mary said
and i'm' like you know what i'm' gon+ na have to take
and i was good
i went
yeah
oh ok
yeah yeah i know yeah la sopa de garbanzos
uhuh
yeah
so i had that
but it was hot as heck so i had to wait
because i was like you know i'm' gon+ na i'm' gon+ na see
yeah i'll' do it
right i'm' gon+ na i'm' gon+ na wait you know
afterwards i'm' like you know what i might as well take it because i don't wan+ na like yesterday
that was today
that was today
oh
and then i said did you know
i'm' like
you know
yeah
oh my god
i don't know
no but they 're negative
you 've got+ ta run in the other direction como dice mia
yeah
i know
she was telling
who was she telling that
she was telling
was it mia or er
yeah she told that guy that one time when we were out
no but she said it yesterday too
oh i didn't
she told somebody
i don't know if it was with us or with emily
you know what
when you see people like that you run in the other direction
you don't wan+ na be there
or was it caroline
they were saying that
maybe it was caroline
she goes you don't wan+ na be
oh caroline is so funny
i have to call her
oh my god she called at eight thirty this morning
but i didn't hear the phone
and then i heard a message
i go because i had put the phone on low yesterday on silent
right
so i and i see a missed call and a message
and she goes oh sam i need to talk to you um i found a website with the and i think there's you should check it out because i'm' not too sure that's a good energy
so mary writes to me mary writes to me
and she goes oh boy i 've got a call from caroline
so it wasn't just you
she called her too
everybody
eight thirty in the morning
oh my god
and mary picked up the phone
and she's like she told her oh i need to talk to you because i don't know you need to check this out we need to have a conversation i don't think it's that good you need to be aware
she goes she called to warn me
and i was like are you kidding me
i go well
so i answered her
i go she wrote me an e-mail i mean she called me up and i'm' gon+ na call her later
and mary goes well this is what it's about this is what it's about
and i'm' like ok well i guess you know i'll' talk to her and see
but yesterday when she was leaving mary's house she goes
she's so funny
she tells me
she i go what did you think
she goes oh it's nice and this and this and the energy
she goes but i don't know the jewish thing that's funny
she goes i don't know do you think it has anything to do with the jewish you know i 've had really bad experiences with jewish people i don't want anything that belongs to them
i go caroline you need to break that not all jewish people are bad
i heard i heard when you said that
but the thing is did you feel anything negative while you were there
right she was happy
no
no
she was happy
she was you know
so then why would you
because if you feel something all of a sudden
right if you feel bad
because usually you feel bad you know
exactly
that was funny
like that time that you had that coughing fit
right
you know
but she and then but she went to check it out which's smart in her part
that she found i don't know what she found
but i i guess i'll' find out tonight
and i guess from
you know i don't think so
i need to ask david because he's the one that got the mail today
aw because yours should have come in
and then i'm' gon+ na call for trevor tomorrow to see that
well i what i had done is i had emailed myself the thing saying that june six though the eight like that we have which is what i had emailed kelly
right
but remember i had emailed her the one that
from san francisco
from san francisco
and i said it's the same except you know put
right
and i go to trevor this is what you'll' be getting er a confirmation this way
right
but apparently he left it there like he went
when i got+ ta my desk today on my chair
he had put the papers
and what he did friday
you know the meeting he went to friday
uhuh
which of course he slept probably through it
and the other thing that he does is set certain colours
you know how kids do
yeah
so everything was coloured
doodle
so when i find him i go i saw that you had fun
i go and i also noticed you only had blue pen with you because you didn't do it in colours like you normally do
so he was cracking up
i go what do you want me to do with it
he goes it's the same shit as always go ahead and just file it you know
yeah
i said ok
that he had taken it
so i went ahead
but you don't know they received it
no
he didn't say so i guess not
yeah
i looked
and he had taken it
aw
so i guess you know
oh and i asked him
yeah and i 've
i said
i said are you going with are you are you gon+ na go by yourself on friday or do you want us to pick you up
and he goes no it's ok i'll' go by myself
i said yeah you don't want a car full of women huh
and he goes no
i go you have enough with ladies
he goes yes
i said ok
hi
kelly said she'll' go by on her own because she doesn't know she's gon+ na be there exactly at seven eight or eight
yeah
but maybe she'll' do like julia and go after she after making sure that everything is ok at school
the
oh ok
but they 've got+ ta remember that they are not gon+ na be let in until after the break
ok
no i'll' remind her
and they have to be there porque si no ya despues
no no i'll' remind her
but she was like no i don't think so
because i said are we picking you up
and she was no no no i'll' go on my own i know how to get there i'll' go on my own and then then you know
because i guess i guess she's like lidia
just make sure that everything's ok at school and then go
oh yeah they start early anyways probably
yeah they if they start the way they 're supposed to it's at seven thirty
yeah they leave what ten thirty
but now you don't have to turn in the er you know you don't have to
the keys
yeah they turn in the keys
but you don't have to do grade the bubble sheets anymore
oh really
like it's all electronic
oh electronic
oh that's cool
right so that's why nowadays if you 've get a check off sheet it's like
yeah seven thirty or so
ah we don't have to turn in grade bubble sheets which was the important stuff
yeah which was everything that i was always behind
yeah now the problem will be that if some of these people aren't like for her right now she should already be inputting the grades and uploading them
because if they start waiting you know what
computers are gon+ na be stuck and slow and all that stuff which is what happens in the other quarters
oh really
yeah
so i had um another albert called me
and he and i got some of his papers
and he goes no i'm' putting the other one
he goes what date are we supposed to print out our class list for you
and i said well it's always supposed to be the last day of the quarter but that would be the fifth
mmhm
and then he goes yeah but
i go yeah but i'm' sure you have mostly seniors so you know what
just do
and i doubt it that you 're gon+ na be having any kids with drop today
so you might as well print it out today
he goes ok ok
i think so
oh ok
no because what you can do then is like what we did with caroline
well i'll' ask him i'll' ask him
yeah
because
right
maybe that's what needs done i don't know
unless like the kids are home
but they can call you
like that's what i did with caroline like i went with rachel and um
we 're doing a study
like i went with rachel then what we did is that when we got there i called you know with the cell phone
yeah
everybody was like hey where are you we 're over here you know whatever you know
right
oh and is she gon+ na go now
caroline
a volunteer
she goes what
and then mia said she had been oh the millionaire that's right you guys have that coming up
and then mia goes oh have you been
and she goes yeah i went last year are you going this time
she goes oh i didn't know anything i didn't get anything
who
caroline
caroline
i thought she knew because we talked about it
emily said she's hilarious
and then that's when i guess mary said is going
and then she goes oh is maria going i could always go with one of her tickets
that's what she said
eh
and i was like
thinking to myself
i thought that won't work
one of them was mine
but ok
actually i put mary with me
ok
trevor and julia
and then trevor and and julia are together
but if she needs me to sign her up i'll' sign her up
yeah
i don't know
she told me
and i go tonight fill out the thing caroline you don't know that just fill it out and you know what even if you don't get your tickets in time your name is already there
right
exactly
that's the most important thing
yeah because the ticket i think is just a
yeah
it doesn't have a
it doesn't have your name on it or anything
it's just
exactly
you know
they do have
registered people would take it over here
and they do have this
and then they have the others that
you know
you know
i was noticing that
when
during the thing when mia was going around asking what did you feel what did you see
she was happy though
i know but
and she looked
you know
no but she went before me
oh yeah was a yeah
right
but she's the one that started it
so it went around that way
because she jumped
and said you know i felt this oh my god i remember buying you know
and it was all good
i know exactly so
if you are feeling all good why all of a sudden do you wan+ na
yeah
did you like it
and she goes no it was good it was interesting
and she goes it's totally different from maria jose
and then i go yeah because it's it's a lot higher level and
you know
she goes but you know what's weird
and i go what
i go what did you feel
she goes oh my god
she goes you know like when your heart is racing and whatever
she goes
like a
she goes not racing but like
oh you got butterflies in your stomach i felt them
but it was butterflies like up in my
and i go did it go away
she goes after a while at first it was still there
i go yeah
mmhm
she goes i had such a bad feeling like she's not gon+ na get better
well that's the one that maybe she said she had no hope
she had lost all the hope
right
that no that she yeah she lost hope and she and she um
they 've taken her life force
did you hear when pia said they took her life worse
yeah
when they take your life force that's it
you don't have no more life
right
your life force is sucked
yeah
so it takes a lot to put it back into you
i was gon+ na say yesterday for this young man
but i really didn't know his name
which one
martha's
oh
stepson
but i don't really know his name
i know she calls him dani
so i think his name is daniel
oh
but i wasn't
yeah
totally sure
you know
and i was like
yeah
do i
or don't i
you know
but we can do it
you have the powers
yeah
that's right
the healing
this is something that he doing for linguistics
that means how do we speak
but it's for and i because and i are the ones that switch languages
you don't
yeah
so
no yesterday was fine
i was doing
i started coughing which i i i was
but there was something going around because i felt it
i felt like
but i was
there was one part
oh my god i'm' holding on to it
i was trying
that's why after i went to the bathroom
i hold on to it
and then i i said ok bring them bring the healing thing
but i will feel it
and i was like
very
it's because you are trying to stop it or block it
i don't know
in one of the books we 've read
doesn't it say that
like when someone's saying something
and you start coughing
or that's what pam
you know
yeah
one of those things that she says that you
like when people when they 're saying something
and and
you don't wan+ na answer
and you 're like
right you don't wan+ na face up
or you 're lying or whatever
you
oh yeah i 've heard that
so i was like
it's not like you are lying
and she's talking
and i start coughing
and i'm' like why am i coughing
there's nothing
you know
i know there must have been something going around
you know so i'm' like
i think there was
you know
and patty was funny
she was watching the birds
mmhm
they were they were flying in and out and
patty has a really good um
she's bright
she's very bright
mmhm
you know
very happy all the time
like you know
her students should take after her porque la la esa
she's taking a class mary
yeah i heard you say that
i heard you told mum
see
it was funny when mary said patty is coming
i mean i know that patty was the other one
but then she said chetan
chetan is normally
for us it's usually a guy's name
really
at least all the chetans i 've even known have been guys
oh really
yeah
so when she said chetan
and i told mom i was thinking of the one that we went to her house
so i thought it was the the lady who had been to her house
go to mom's
and then when they show up in their both
the at the last thing that we went to
remember that we had the gelatos
that's right
but like we don't really
no that's sally
right but i don't really remember her name
yeah
so i go to mom es una pareja
and then they show up
and they 're two women
i don't think sally would like that very much
no exactly
and the other lady's married so
so is samy
and samy was saying something about her husband
uhuh oh really
yeah because she comes into
when johnny was as rude as he was
oh my god
i haven't spoken to linda
she was throwing away
but you know what
that was out of control
when she was started throwing away some of the stuff she goes do you recycle
and them um said yes
my husband says you should be happy i recycle as much as i do
oh i'll' be happy when you recycle everything
so that's the way i figured she's married
oh ok
to a man not
yeah to
so
but she's she's really cute
she's very bright
yeah
very bright
yeah
yeah
yeah very
like and you know what i
you didn't see it did you
no
oh my god
mom told me
were you were you here when mom was telling me
well i i watched her because we had our eyes closed
yeah the whole time i was
you know when we opened her eyes
and then she would say oh do this now
or she would all of a sudden start
right
me she would get these lines right here
and she her mouth would like twist
really
and then that's when she would start
you know one of the two
yeah one of the one of the
and it's like mad
and then you could
like she was struggling to get the words out in english
right
or something like that
you know
yeah
so it was like wow
your mom told me she she had four different faces
i was like really i never seen her
yeah
because i don't pay attention
i go into my thing
and even her hands kind of twisted a little
i was like wow
really
yeah
i'm' gon+ na my things
and you know i don't
which is funny because to be like you like you say she's as enlightened as she is
she's enlightened
she's got her thing
she you know
right but you think she 'd be more open
maybe she's more like marta
because she wants to then figure out why is it that they 're like that
why do they have this
what language were you chatting in
yeah
you know and what
just let her chat
yeah well because she she chanced also
yeah i know but
at the meditation thing
yeah i know but still
you know that that mary and i were laughing because she has this thing about i don't want religion nothing to do with religion
and blah blah blah
but i was telling mary yeah but they do it worse
we went to the meditation
and she goes
she forgot i went
and she goes oh maria went with me to the meditation
she goes she totally forgot i went
and i go yeah and it's cute and everything
and i go but they actually idolize a living person
come on
yeah oh really
oh you didn't go to the meditation centre with us
no
oh my god sam
it's beautiful
let me tell you
the the meditation thing is is just gorgeous
but it's a lady that i heard about when they read they read things
and um i read it in a magazine in new york
people actually go see this lady
and they bow down to her and everything
she's like a god
and in this place they have candles and pictures of her
and the people light candles to this lady
i was like there's something wrong with this picture
oh no that's weird
yeah that's weird
i would never like do that
hi baby
doing good
that's good
so i was like they are doing worse you don't
yeah that's not
how do you how can you do that
you know
but i heard that the lady is like really like um not like gandh
but you know
yeah
so people from
when the lady goes to new york the lines are out the door
unbelievable
maybe she thinks she's the pope
she thinks she's the pope
well the pope for for that
for that part of
that sect religious sect or whatever
maybe
because when you don't
even if you think it's not a religion it it that's like a a cult
yeah that's a cult
to me that's a cult
yeah that's a cult
i felt like
like the hare krishnas
i mean the meditations were good
you know like the hare krishnas
yeah but that was like a cult
the place is really nice
they are very quiet
it's beautiful
you take off your shoes
it's all red carpet
it's beautiful
of her
oh yeah no that's not good
oh no that's not good
and then they put and they put candles
and i'm' like what is this
and then i ask her then
is she dead
i mean
and then at the end i go who is that
you know
i'll' tell you when they were having the food is awesome
it's all organic
you know like whatever
like raw and stuff
yeah yeah
awesome food
and it's not expensive
so i was like who is that
and then she tells me oh that's
and i go oh i read about her
and one of the things
but i was like why do you light candles to
no because she's like our
not that she's anything
but she's like the head of the thing
and i was like mm that's wrong
yeah
i mean
i'm' sorry
but you know
yeah no that's not
she's still living
why are you lighting
you know
exactly why are you lighting a candle
i mean we light candles
because i like candles
and i pray for everybody but
right but not in front of the picture
no no that's not
well that's not a good thing to put
that's that is it's like you are idolizing
you are idolizing
yeah you are not supposed to idolize anything
that's one of the first things god says
i'm' before everything
and when you put a when you put a picture especially living person
you know
because we do or will say some people do put light light candles for for someone who has just passed away to give them light
right the mexicans do
right
no and the mexicans in that thing they they honour on death day or something
yeah the day after
yeah they put the
no the day of after halloween after halloween
yeah they put the candles
and they put the things for them
and they do
you know
to bring them back
and they put everything that belonged to the person
and they put it on the thing so
it's cool
person

*sastre13.csv*
she is actually putting of her own money
like she
yeah but i think that they
i don't know
and so now what's happening is basically what they 're saying is that in order for barack to win like the entire election in order for him to become president he has to basically get her support
mmhm
so he can get so he can get the rest of the democrats that she has because she has a couple
they want him to get the rest of the democrats
mmhm
and if he gets the rest of the democrats that's it
he becomes the next president
oh my god
yup
has that ever even happened before
a black president
no
no not a
i know that much you know hello
ok ok
well i'm' saying like has that ever happened before like when they like
when when two people like running like that
i'm' not
no i'm' saying like that they already know who's gon+ na win from like before
no no no it's not that they already know who's gon+ na win
what's happened is basically that um they 're running against each other for the same within the same party
mmhm
like they 're both on the same team if you will
oh ok
and basically like you know there's there comes a certain point when you you already know
like they keep like you know like
oh ok ok ok no now i see what you 're saying
yeah
so now they already know that he's the one that he's gon+ na be running for that team
yeah yeah
so there's no reason for her to still be there
but she doesn't wan+ na give up
that sucks
but whatever
don't feel bad for her
why you want you want obama to win
yeah i want barack obama to win
in a way i want him to win too
but then i was kind of like rooting for girl
you know
yeah of course because you want you know you want her to you know change
yeah yeah i'm' a girl yeah
so what's going on with your hair
it looks very nice today
you know what
i didn't wan+ na brush my hair today
that's why
i didn't i i didn't feel like looking the same today
you look nice though
thank you
you 're welcome
you look nice yourself
i like your hat
thank you i wear it all the time
well thank you
oh yeah
i was gon+ na i was gon+ na tell you that
so why why do you think that i was like mad at you
i don't understand
because hello you didn't talk to me the whole sunday
actually no the reason why is because like like i kind of felt bad like about what happened
and i don't really want like for me to be the issue like between you and my mom
you know like i don't want that i don't want myself to come up in like anyway or form possible like
mmhm
and it's and like kind of i was just kind of like well you know like like i don't know what to do
because the thing is like the thing is i you know
mmhm
yeah
you know i don't have to say it
but it's just like i think sometimes like it when i try to like talk to you and stuff like that like it can be taken as like ammunition you know to like
ammunition what is what what do you mean by that
like the fights can get worse just because you know like something might happen between us or whatever
and i'm' just like
i just kind of felt bad because like the last thing that i want is for you and my mom to fight like over something stupid that happened between us you know
yeah
and i'm' just like whatever
kind of like the same
yeah
go ahead
kind of like what
no go ahead
kind of like what i'm' saying
kind of like the reason you gave for not like doing that thing a long time ago when i asked you
i'm' trying to be like
yes
yeah
i'm' trying to think
it's kind of like the same reason that you gave her
like you don't want like your relationship to go bad because of what happens between us basically
ok
you
but um what was i gon+ na tell you
but i wasn't mad at you
like it doesn't make any sense

because the thing is like the the thing is like ok look
let's be honest with each other
like i would+ a gone like if i really wanted to go to the concert i would+ a gone regardless
like i would+ a just bought the tickets
mmhm
like i would+ a just said forget elizabeth i'm' going
ok i know where you 're going with that
ok but but like at the same time you know you know it's not just like you know going together
i know
that's not the point
the point is going together and having a good time
mmhm
and i know you wanted to go to the concert
so it was important you know that you had a good time
yeah
so when you tell me like oh i didn't even have a good time
i was like
i didn't
it was
i was like great
so like
it was good because you know i got+ ta go
whatever and i saw her
oh she's she did really good actually
yeah
yeah she looked really pretty
yeah
but
i felt bad
because i knew like from you were like
ah whatever
i don't wan+ na talk about it anymore
yes yes let's not let's not
anyways there will be more
ok
there will be more
oh so now you 're saying there will be more concerts
yes
there will be
and i'm' gon+ na make sure that you go that you go with me the next one
because i feel really bad
for that
not for that
but i know you wanted to go too so
yeah ok
no comment
ok
but anyways
so yeah that's all you did today
um
yeah i kinda helped my parents out a little bit
um i was kinda i kinda figured that i would just be doing this
so i was like ah you know whatever
mmhm
i 've been studying for the for the g_r_e too
you know like
yeah
but like there's a lot of vocabulary in that thing
i have like four hundred like index cards that i did
additional index cards of like words and stuff like that so
wow
and like wow that's a lot of stuff
like i 've just been writing like this whole time like just putting all the words on index cards
it's taking me forever
mmhm
wow
so what are you what are you when are you planning to take that test
i don't know
i really don't know
i mean i thought i would be done by you know by mid june
and i'm' still like taking down like words you know so
yeah
i took a practice test though
really how 'd you do
i got
do you know yet or no
i did really i did better on the math than i did on the
oh there's a math part
yeah
oh my god
yes
i hate math
yea
there's a and a math portion
i did ok like
i had not really studied
i had just looked over everything really briefly
mmhm
but whatever
like it's weird
like the test basically like adapts itself to you
like it asks you questions
and then like if you get them wrong it asks it asks your an easier question
mmhm
and it goes like that
it asks you hard questions and easier questions
ok
you know the c_b_t's like that
really
mmhm
yeah
if you like if if you take like let's say there's a question or whatever and like it's really hard and you get it wrong it like keeps lowering and stuff like up to like
or it asks you questions like if you 're like stupid like
you know i really wish you had come to that party
really
yeah
i really do
i wanted to come here but
it would+ a been it would+ a been a lot better
i procrastinate on everything
i think you know to be honest with you i think that given enough time like like you would+ a become like really like really really good friends i think
yeah
because we get along for the most part
yeah
i'm' nice
i'm' a nice person
i'm' not mean
i'm' nice to people
who said anything about being mean
you know i'm' just saying i'm' nice to people in general
hey don't get a big head on me all right
i'm' not getting a big head
i'm' just saying like i'm' nice
like even when like i even remember like in high school and stuff like the people that like the kids that nobody would wan+ na talk to like i would be
aw
no seriously
you 're a philanthropist
even though i was pretty popular you know
no seriously
that's so messed up
i would i would be one of those people like i would be like hi what's your name
even though sometimes those kids they 're really bitter
oh of course of course
they 're really bitter
but they 're they used to be mean
but i still was nice you know
what about me
i felt bad
what you think i wasn't popular in high school
no
what what are you saying
i didn't say nothing
you said no
that was a reaction
no i wouldn't say like no i never thought that but
i was gon+ na tell you um
i was actually really popular in middle school
and then like because of how popular i was in middle school i decided that i didn't wan+ na be popular anymore
really
no seriously i was like really popular yeah
it sounds funny though the way it's being said
no it's TRUE
it happened
it was something about my hair
really
it made me cool
yeah
because i used to have like a a
i told you this
i used to have a lot of hair
mmhm
and it was like really curly
and i used to put a lot of gel in it
yeah
so all the girls would be like oh let me touch your hair
and i 'd be like hey
you know i like mohawks

then in the afternoon it was like hard like all
yeah
and it was like curled and stuff like that
yeah i used to use more gel than i use now
my hair used to be like rock hard
like it was like
rock hard
yeah it was bad
i don't think it's not like like as you get older you realize that it's not necessary necessarily necessary
you know
yeah
it's just something that you know it's cool like when you 're growing up
you 're like oh
you wan+ na do something with your hair
so you start slicking it back
and everybody's like oh watch out
yeah
yeah yeah yeah
so are you so are you ready for the wedding
am i ready for the wedding
yeah
you know i'm' still trying to decide ah on how many days i'm' gon+ na spend up there
really
why
yeah
my father's coming uh a little bit after my mom with my brother
oh yeah i think you 're mom told me something like that
so he's only gon+ na be there for like three days
so they 're so like the weekend basically
yeah
and i don't know whether i wan+ na like go in for like the entire week or just spend the weekend
like i'm' still i still haven't decided
ok
yeah
i'm' trying to figure that out
the thing is like the thing is like once the thing is when you get up there you 're gon+ na see like they 're really like in wedding mode you know like
wedding mode
wedding mode
you know so it's all about the wedding
and like you really you feel out of place
it's like you go
and like you 're a girl so you 're gon+ na be fine
and you 're gon+ na
yeah
you know they 're gon+ na be like oh yeah you know help me put on this dress whatever let's go shopping for the shoes we still need this
yeah
and they 're gon+ na take you with them
they 're gon+ na drag you up and down all over the place
uhuh
with guys it's different
like you can't
like that you don't really get included you know like that
you know you hang out with the other guys and
yeah yeah
like i guess i guess the only reason to go would be to just get to know um isabella a little bit better
you know my cynthia's son
oh yeah
yeah
and probably fernando because honestly like i don't know either of them like any of them like luis you know junior luis like
mmhm
and fernando like i 've met him
and like talked to him like maybe like twice and stuff like that
but i really haven't
i don't even know him that well you know
my mom's spent like uh like two weeks up there
yeah yeah
like he took her out and whatever
yeah
they got+ ta know each other so
what about
how do you feel about it
i'm' excited and nervous at the same time
yeah
i'm' excited because i haven't been on vacation since like i went to go see my dad which that was like two thousand one two thousand two i think
yeah yeah
yeah
so i'm' excited about gon+ na the airport and stuff because i love the airport
and i 've never been to a wedding before
you 've never been to a wedding before
never been to a wedding
that's shocking
so i'm' excited to see what it's like you know
that is shocking
it's really nice
it's really nice
like you have a party
it's it's nice
yeah
so i'm' excited about that
but i'm' nervous because like oh my god
i don't know twenty people and stuff so
no i mean i mean for the most part like my mom tends to hang out with um uh cynthia
cynthia
mmhm mmhm
so whatever you'll' get to know her
and cynthia you already know
yeah
and cynthia is just her sister you know so
that's it
yeah
and then like on my father's side of the family i don't know what they 're gon+ na do with that
i don't know if they 're gon+ na introduce you to my father's side of the family
that remains to be seen
like my mom doesn't
like they get along
but it's just like they 're
they 've had a lot of problems you know like
a lot of stuff has happened
yeah
tough stuff with them
my brother loves though you know
oh yeah
you know you can't get enough of them because they 're they 're more like
i guess they 're more er um
how can i say this urban centric
you know more like he is
yeah
because he doesn't he doesn't take after like the whole christian side you know
and like cynthia you know
oh yeah yeah
and cynthia and their cities are more like christian and stuff like that
yeah
i mean they 're cool and stuff like that but
you know they 're christians so you can't you know certain things there are certain limits to what you can do you know
yeah yeah
but whatever we'll' see we'll' see how it goes
but yeah
yeah
yeah the school's really big
the school is really big
yes
yeah it kinda is
it gets bigger all the time
my school i i kinda get lost sometimes in the school to be honest
because i don't really do too much
you just go in and study and come back
go to class
and sometimes i stay like you know like just relax and look around
yeah
when i when i'm' when i'm' not in a hurry to get home
yeah
why would you be in a hurry to get home
that's exactly it
i'm' i'm' not in a hurry
i'm' never in a hurry to get home
i thought i don't think i'm' ever home
that's the thing
i think i only to go like sleep
yeah
you don't think you 're ever home
you know that's
it happens though
it's not it's not just you
a lot of people live like that
yeah
i know
the to be honest with you like that's one of the things that i'm' very grateful for right now that i have so much free time in the summer
mmhm
because i 've come to realize that especially during the these last two semesters at school like i 've been spending just so much time like just doing crazy stuff like trying to get stuff done
mmhm
and always like hurrying
and always being like you know
trying to be like one step ahead of everything
yeah yeah
and i'm' like
like i don't know like about maybe like a week ago is when i finally just like let go of all that
you know just like just relax
and finally just let it go
yeah
like you don't really have to do anything tomorrow you know just
yeah
and like i i rested
and i was like
i realize like man you know like man so much time like gets wasted on like you know watching television you know like looking stuff up on the internet
something you don't even need to look up just like garbage
yeah
you know and it's like
yeah
when i finally just let it go i was just like ah
like i finally like just read i finally i read an entire magazine like between yesterday and today
yeah
and i was like oh this is great
god
you know i read the entire magazine
that's something really like oh my god like
so already have like your bachelors
like i i wish i could already be there like
i feel like school is like i like
i mean it's not it's not enough
i mean just having a bachelors is not
it's it's all about you
you know it really is about you
mmhm
yeah
you know like i i like the degree
i'm' not gon+ na lie to you
i think it's nice and everything
but i don't think the degree defines who i am you know
mmhm
it's the degree is just a reflection of like my commitment you know of what i decided to do you know in my life you know
like i already i had i already knew like that summer like when i came back to school that you know i was gon+ na finish
one way or another i was gon+ na finish
and the only thing that i kept telling me uh telling myself is like colin you have four years left
you know you just have to hang in there for four years
just keep going
yeah
that's the only way i made it through
there were times when like like i was like really messed up where it's like you know i had to stay up for like three a_m in the morning four a_m in the morning like writing a paper and stuff like that
and it's hard
it was funny
last night i was talking to maria for awhile
and like she like she was we were just talking about it like man
yeah
i was telling her the same thing i'm' telling you like that i feel like i just started college
and like oh my god like three more years
and like not even because i haven't finished my first year yet
and then she's like well you know think about like this like
she said that like
and it's the same it's the same thing i was thinking
like in high school like when you were a freshman you were thinking the same thing
mmhm
you were just oh my god four years of high school it's gon+ na take forever
right
and like now it's like you think about it
and like man it's already been a year that i'm' out of high school
hmm
you know and it's like now you wish you could go back
you know
so it's like
i mean even though high school's very different from college
but either way you know
it just depends
i mean there's a point in your life when you realize that
i like that's interesting that you say that
because i don't really know what exactly it is about high school that you wan+ na go back like what it is about high school that you like so much
that's the thing
what it is about high school that i
that's a very easy question ok
what is it
you don't have
in high school like everything was easy for everybody mostly everybody ok you
you didn't have you had responsibilities
but not as big as the ones we have
and ok i'm' i'm' gon+ na be honest with you
yeah
in high school i barely remember it
like i think the most times that i ever like opened a book was like three times to study
mmhm mmhm
right
you know
and then in college i 've had to learn like your your grade is based on tests
mmhm
you know if you don't open that book and read you 're gon+ na fail
right
you know
so it's like so then like i guess like in college now i'm' kind of trying to like redeem myself for high school
because i didn't do good in high school like
right right
i was an average student
i i had like a what
i graduated with like a two point like six or something a two point seven like
right
when i was that actually my my my college g_p_a went down to a two point one so
yeah
yeah
but
no what am i
wait
two point one
no what am i talking about
one point a one point two
yeah
but i guess in a way like in college i'm' trying to do my best that i can
you know and then i realize i'm' like
because i never thought like i would look at those like like smart kids and stuff
and it's like nah
and like i wish i could go back
and like get like bright futures and all that crazy stuff and
well
it's it's
i don't think it's really about
i don't know
i 've been to people's houses that like you know that you know have education have an education
and they have several degrees
and stuff like that
and to be honest with you it's not
you know i look at their lives
and and i don't really want that life
you know like that's not what i want
yeah
you know i don't look at their lives and say like wow you know i envy that
you know and that's what i want
yeah
um the only to me like the only motivation for me to like do well is is first for myself and also for you know for whatever future i might have with somebody else basically
mmhm
you know i think of it in that in that sense you know
i i always wan+ na be i always have a backup plan you know
i always wan+ na be prepared in case anything might happen
yeah
and it's just having a better life for you know for not just yourself but for other people too
you know
yeah
you bring something to the table like you know whenever like you meet anybody
so yeah but trust me
just because you have an education doesn't mean squat like
it's TRUE
like that girl that i told you about that i like i went out for like a for like a month she was like she's working on her masters now and it's like like you just feel bad for her
like honestly that's the only thing i can tell you
like i felt bad for her
because like there's nothing you can do like
you know it's like she's thirty and she still hasn't figured out that you know if she doesn't like put on the batteries like she's just gon+ na be alone for like the rest of her life like
oh my god you see that's something i don't want
i don't wan+ na be alone
my god she's like thirty
and like she she just turned thirty
and she's like still like going out like partying and drinking and stuff like that
yeah
and it's just like
i'm' like
and like she's having such a hard time like letting go of like that part of her life
like she's kinda like has like half and half right now
my god
so whatever i'm' like whatever
but that's you know that's that's her choice
you know like that's her choice
what ends up what happens with most people though is that um they don't realize that they don't really know what they want you know
i actually asked this to my mom the other day
like i was like tell me the truth when you were like young you know did you know what you want with your life
and she was like no
and i was like ah ha you see i knew it
and i just walked away
that's what happens though
that's what happens
that's why i try to think about that sometimes
like man i hope i'm' choosing like the right career
and like
just the thing is
i'm' trying to learn like one thing i'm' trying to change about myself now is like
because like you 're though like these last couple of months man like it's been hitting me hard like
like like now i'm' trying to like realize like man like
i used to be so happy all the time you know
and then like there like they used to be like like this these last couple of months i'm' like oh my god
and you know like i was thinking that this isn't me you know like
mmhm
i didn't i used to care but like not where i made it like the centre of my life you know like
mmhm
you know what you know why because what ends up happening is that eventually the problems that you might not have paid attention to like you eventually say to yourself you know i got+ ta resolve them
yeah
it happened to me too
there are problems that you have to take care of
yeah
but i don't know
like i'm' i'm' i'm' good now
i'm' not
you just have to learn to be happy regardless of what you 're doing
yeah i know
regardless of what you 're doing
you just have to learn how to do that
like me it doesn't where you put me
my mom laughs
she's like it's fine you know you can come like a week before the wedding it doesn't matter we'll' just put you in the living room with a book and you'll' be fine
yeah
it's TRUE
so that's something that you have to learn
like but whatever
no it's you know it's interesting
what
i dunno like
i think that sometimes that i think we try to get away from from feeling you know and and thinking about things about things that should matter
you know
you think
i think so
i think that that's the point of having so many distractions
yeah
for example i think that sometimes people get scared of being like absolutely alone like with nothing going on
really
yeah
like people get like you put them in like for example have you
what's the longest you 've spent like by yourself with like nothing going on
i don't even think like five minutes like i
you see
you see
i hate it
like oh my god
like
but why
i dunno
why do you hate it
that's one thing about me like that's like really like oh my god
i hate being alone
like i hate being alone
i don't like being alone
if i'm' in my house and i'm' like oh my god like there's nothing to do nobody here like i'm' leaving
you know like i would run
yeah you go do something else right
i'm' just gon+ na go for a drive or something and like blast my music
i dunno it's like you know
i i'm' actually quite like the opposite
like the thing is this like it's hard like it's hard to get to a place where you 're just like you 're alone like and you can actually think you know and just think about whatever comes into your head you know like
mmhm
you know why are things the way they are you know
have all these like weird thoughts
and it's like
i feel like most of your life you go through you go through it
you know you just
people like yelling in your ear all the time
that's what it feels like to me
like it feels like people are always yelling at me
you know like not literally
you know what i mean like
no like people literally yell at me all the time
but that's what i feel like it's like it's happening
like there's always like something going on
and then it's never like we never get a chance to just like think
yeah
you know just like concentrate on like
it's funny because it's like
i 've been sitting around and thinking about the test you know and studying for it
and i'm' thinking to myself man you know it's taking so long
i wanted to get it done in a month
mmhm
you know i was like yeah you know i'm' gon+ na study for a month and that's it
it's gon+ na be over and that's it
i don't have to think about it any more
yeah
and you know what i 've realized
that the things that surround you make you wan+ na like do things faster by not paying as much attention to them
you know or not put as much value to them
you know and i think that's just i think it shouldn't be that way
yeah
i think that sometimes you really have to slow down and think about what it is that you have you know and appreciate it
it's TRUE
but i don't think i don't think that a lot of people have that mentality
well i don't think that a lot of people can even even think about that stuff
i mean period so
yeah
you know what i what i found in the back of a magazine about three three days ago
guess what i found
guess what i found three days ago
what
um popeye
no way
a d_v_d collection for popeye
really
yeah
ah
oh i haven't seen popeye in forever
that used to be one of my favorite shows
i know
i know
i know
aw that's so cool
i was like i looked at it
and i was like hmm
oh my god do you know what i used to watch a lot too
i used to watch the power rangers
what
yeah
and the ninja turtles
power rangers was when it first came out was really popular
yeah
a popular show
aw i miss all those things
and it's like it's on is gone on like forever
power rangers is still on on the air
yeah but
it's just in like weird like cable channels
yeah but i don't think it would be the same as
oh
or i don't know if it's
like ok because you like the other day
not the other day
but like like i would start like
once like when i was in high school and i was like a freshman i was like man like
now like you know you see like christmas and all those things
yeah and like man the holidays the holidays any more
do you think it's because you view it differently because you 're older now
like
it has to do it has to do with the same thing that i told you about before
because you don't put as much value to it as you used to
oh yeah
that's it
it's been thirty minutes
then get outta here
we 're having a conversation
um i think it's for the same reason
really
yeah
yeah
so maybe it does have a little bit to do with people growing
i think if you slow down i think it would be still as important
because it's not it's to be honest with you it is it's not about the presents
it's really more about the feelings that you get and you know like what you want
christmas spirit
yeah exactly
yeah
you know like that anxiety of like getting up at like twelve a_m in the morning to open up your gift
i used to love christmas
just because you wan+ na see what your parents got you
yeah
i used to do that all the time
i remember one time i got some like transformers
and i was like transformers
oh my god
and i played with them like over and over
you know um they started working on transformers two like
oh the movie
yeah like the first of june
oh really
i didn't know that
yeah
yeah they started working on it
because i was watching the the
what's it called
movie awards i think
yeah the movie awards on sunday
it was on a sunday
yeah i think it was on sunday
and one of the guys from the movie whatever he he won an award
your hair looks really nice
so there
oh thank you
and uh you know what
i was gon+ na tell you
um we went to the worst theatre this weekend
what theatre
the one in homestead
the absolute worst theatre you can imagine
the one in homestead
it's called flagship cinemas
oh my god yeah i i went in there once because kathy lives in homestead
oh my god
we tried to go there one time
but i never got+ ta go inside inside
oh it's terrible
it is really
like we
why did you end up going there
because the thing is like we wanted to see the forbidden kingdom

like it's it's leaving theatres
oh ok
so it was only being shown at uh
what's it called flagship you know flagship and some theatre in kendall

um the guy one of the guys that were from the transformers the first one
i don't know who he was

um he went up there
and he was like oh so much
and then he's like oh we just started filming

i don't know if you guys know but from um they 're gon+ na start giving us a c_j_bat test at work
at work
yeah
online
the um the classroom is gon+ na be set up as a testing area
oh wow
and that's why
and i'm' sure you 're gon+ na be involved with that
and why is that
um
we 're not really
money
yes you are
no
they only helped us
well but
that had nothing to do with
yeah but does he has to set up the software
no
no that's the system
how about the ok saying is why is they gon+ na start giving out the tests
ah at the headquarters uhuh
ok
you know the scheduling
it's gon+ na be three times in a week
it's gon+ na be monday wednesday and friday or something like that or
mhmm
or or morning time
if it's in the afternoon then they do the orientation
they 're gon+ na do orientation
not really
nuhuh
uhuh
no no
i don't think so
before you
he had
oh ok
whether you apply or not
and you get a p_h_q
yeah but that makes sense
right
no it doesn't
taking the test first
you don't think so
you apply so you have a statistic of how many people applied
you gon+ na apply
well
uhuh
ok
yes or no
what are you gon+ na do about that
then they have to go and apply
go online
right
but the only problem i see is
why give them a p_h_q
yeah but that's that's gon+ na cause a lot of problems
if the people that you 're having come in for the c_j_bat have not applied in that's gon+ na delay more your procedure
why what but why is it gon+ na be done like that
why not give them the orientation first
that's what i said
and then the c_j_bat test in the afternoon if they 're interested
i mean doesn't that make more sense right for them to have the orientation
eh
let them see what it's about
see if they 're interested
and if they 're not interested they don't come back in the afternoon for their c_j_bat test
exactly
that was my idea
i 've been giving that
and why they can't accept the bat test
oh right right
um like community college and they only have the f_bat test taken
they don't the c_j_bat test and they accepting that
and now they 're accepting
but all these are state certified um
they became state certified through the um the university
i'm' not qualified
right
i'll' say that to him
that doesn't make sense
i did tell him that
i don't agree with it
because you 're gon+ na spend more money on p_h_qs giving it out to the people
it's gon+ na go in the garbage
right
and you 're gon+ na get people that after they take the test are gon+ na say oh this isn't for me
once they hear the orientation
no that doesn't make sense
three times and within the year
and how much does listen
and different versions
that test how much does it cost us
nine dollars
a person
ok so once again why would you have the person spend the money you know why should we spend nine dollars for somebody that after you have the orientation might not even be interested in the position
that's not cost effective
numbered that's what they want
no
boy i i would have gotten into a good argument with him with that if i would have known that
you 're not gon+ na win it
you 're not gon+ na win it
what did you say landon
what are they gon+ na do
freeze it
ah nothing
budget
mmm
budget cuts
things are bad
uhhuh
wow
so you had the the the summer off
oh my god
yeah
wow
incredible
that happened to me when i was about to graduate um we have that class they weren't they were not teaching the class doing that semesters
so that i had to wait because we didn't have enough people
but that makes sense i mean you know
it makes sense because we 're the ones that deal with it
and we know what you go through you know
of course
ah the larger the file the more time it's gon+ na take you to do everything that you have to do
why
they 're gon+ na do it now
yeah they 're gon+ na have a job opening for every month
three hundred
not that many
i don't think you'll' have that many
five hundred people
yeah it could be
it could be
by now i have two hundred
i had two hundred this morning before i scheduled them two weeks period
in a two week period
it's not just saying that you have three thousand
like like right now i have three thousand nine hundred people applicants on a list than having five hundred only that you can scroll down and and and choose from that
why
so that's why that's why i thought it um it was better for us
well actually it was better for me because i'm' the one who works with the program
ok
because i'm' gon+ na be doing
you know why because you know why because i was told to teach daniela everything i do
i'm' gon+ na i'm' gon+ na be doing testing
i'm' trying to put two and two together
right
oh no no
the forget it
it's not that's not the way it works
the counting doesn't work that way
and they are not gon+ na put it
over that
i don't know either
where
where are they doing
but they they set up meetings
they set up like sign-ins and stuff
i don't know
do you see it
do you guys see a list
i don't see nothing
i don't see nothing
so what is it they take when they go to these recruitings
and they put up a little table there
and then they taking people signing up people
well you know and they
so who gets that list of people signing up or whatever
if they go on the
so how do so how who is seeing that they 're doing what they 're supposed to be doing
looking beautiful
and who were these people
germany
you gave them copies
we didn't give copies of
oh well that's right
i remember when last year they came from spain or something
the
i remember
he said no you have to be certified
oh my god
meatlover yeah
meatlover over here
that's you right
oh that looks good
wow
my god
but what is that actually
thank you
ay thank you
i i'm' gon+ na smell like a fried ah chicken
no
positive
worse
it's been worse
we had more applicants before than now
right
some of them don't even have email so they they don't have a computer so they have to go to the library or friends house
some people have to do an application three times before they can get it correctly
uhhuh
before it can go through the whole screening and downtown screens them and everything sometimes three times they have to do it
wow
yeah yeah
thank you
no but listen listen mason
ok
i'm' expecting you know a response right away
you know and and the way it's going now is is running running too slow
the application is going in too slow
you know what was funny here in this meeting
there's this man sitting next to me from t e_t_s_c
very he's like very intelligent you know
and um he he gives us this whole presentation in paper with diagrams and with ah pictures and
i i mean like nice presentation
well the lieutenant took over the presentation from the beginning to the end like if he had done the presentation
it was incredible
the guy didn't say almost i mean i think that if he said four words
but that's what the what i'm' telling you
that's the problem with the lieutenant
he does not let you speak and put your your your senses into the into a meeting
yeah but
yeah yeah and he spent like maybe months doing this
and the rest of the stuff
that's what
he put it all in writing for us and everything
and and
yes
he knew what he was talking about
yeah he did
but the guy was had more to say about because he's the one who who prepared
and he has also other another form that he he actually a presentation con mas mas y mas este informacion
that we never went through the whole thing
we were laughing about it now in the car
we just skipped pages and skipped pages you know
no but you know what got me
that he wasn't aware of all the problems that you were going through
right
everything that you were doing he had no idea
but see that's the problem lack of communication
right
but you know i think that the bottom line is that because we 're just one department that's having this problem the county is not gon+ na change the whole frigging system for us
you know what i'm' saying
no way
oh did i say a bad word
i mean really
that's how they look at it
they 're not gon+ na change the system for us
well because of the type of position that it is ok you have to keep um tracking it for everything
mhmm
for example
drink water drink water
oh my god what color was it
it was green like a pepper
uh oh
anyhow the um so they hired one position for
and there's they say ah maybe a hundred people apply for the position of secretary
so they screened the hundred
and whoever qualifies for it they will pick out and interview them
in our case no
if you have a position that continues a position like police officer everybody applies to it
and everybody has to rescreen
and everybody's scheduled to take a test
so that's the difference
and that's not the only test that police officers take
they do the polygraph
the they do the the what the medical stuff
what's the other thing that they do
psychological
assessment's gon+ na be taken away now
really
yeah
you mean they 're not gon+ na do it at all
or somebody else is gon+ na do it
they 're not gon+ na do it
because since they gon+ na do it in the academy why have them do it twice
oh like part of the training or something
right
do they get support for that now when they do it
so this is better for them then
mhmm
right
yeah
well if you if you look at it it's more like um maybe more like you think about it
how will you handle this
you know will you ignore this person
they 're testing your skills
or will you
no
how about attitude
will you you assume
i think they 're testing for common sense or your common sense
they 're testing your skills
yeah your skills yeah
how you 're you know how would you react to different situations you know
in front of a situation
yeah
do people actually fail that
of course
they do
yeah
the assessment not a lot
but you have some you know a percentage that that do fail
i think they should definitely also implement the fact that they should be able to see their c_j_bat scores
or maybe automatically when they finish with the c_j_bat test an email gets sent to them saying you got a seventy you got a whatever
now ah well not not now
now no
not with the police officer position
with police complaint officer and police dispatcher they do
you can actually go into um miami day dot gov and to the testing site
and it'll' tell you pass or fail
it's not gon+ na tell you your score though
but that's because the county is the one that sets up those appointments
that's why ours don't they can't be seen
oh my god
crabs
oh
crabs
that must that must be a puertorican word
because i 've never heard of it
crab
crab
crab
new crab
crab
mhmm
but you take it out of the shell
no you eat it with the shell in the shell
you know you just with a fork you know you take it out
but you have to open it from the bottom
mhmm
what's the word that i wan+ na use
florentino
florentino florentino
and he's such a nice guy
that's why i said i don't think you have an option
but he did do one
but not as nice as this
he's just so nice you know
and you can see that he's interested and that he wants to learn and he wants to you know
mason how do you do this how do you do that and this and that
wow
he's not an he's not an office person
in other words she's trying to say que tu vienes de la calle

he's seventy one seventy one years old
and liliana rode with him on the bike

because he went alone
yeah
and then in the way back she drove with another guy from the club that he was alone also
once i get those things squared up boy i see see uh if we uh
but she'll' ride with us
she'll' ride with us
i really do get scared
even though i ride but i have respect to it you know
you 're not that you 're not that well balanced
i ride
you have to be
how do i say
you have to be cut out for that
and you 're going fast
it doesn't work that
no it doesn't work like that
when you wan+ na turn you have to actually with your body turn the motorcycle because it doesn't it actually wants to keep going straight
so you know you turn the wheel
yes you do
but if you could actually turn
and stop moving your feets
come on
the um the
the bike actually you have to actually lean into the way you wan+ na go
you have to push your body weight so the bike will go into the curves
and he didn't lean into it
because you 're afraid the bike's not gon+ na turn
and he just went off the side of the road
or actually it was just about three weeks before nos hicimos miembros d+ el club
yeah he broke he broke three ribs
yeah
poor thing i know
if you 're gon+ na ride it you you can't be afraid of it
because
no you'll' the the biggest problem why people
i am to be honest with you i'm' scared of it
i'm' scared that i won't have the capacity to be able to ride it to learn how to ride it
no i don't
i drive i i ride behind him
no she she she rides behind me
and you know when he leans
she actually doesn't need to grab on to me because my bike it has a a a backrest for her
so when i'm' you know in the back relaxed when he turns i lean a little bit like with
yeah she's learning
yeah she's not like when we first started
so
yeah she would like you know when you get on the curve and if i'm' going really fast you have to really lean in to it you know
but you don't fall because it's all centrifical force
you don't fall
yeah
yes
and alyssa she's gotten used to it
yeah i 've gotten used to it
she she's getting she's
and we have a good time
oh san agustin we love it

they got so many pictures that it was amazing
it was really nice
yeah but we have
we had a great
it's a lot of fun
there's you know right now in the club there's a lot of controversy because there's a lot of people
it's worth it
it is worth it
people that like it
and you can learn how to ride a bike good
and you know you go easy
you maintain the speed limit
you do everything one behind the other one
you don't have no problems
then you 're gon+ na have problems
yeah there's people that race the bikes when we go through twenty seven
just for racing
you know i don't recommend it to anybody
to anybody
no they ride at close to a hundred and sixty miles an hour
no
we 've been on our bike like we 've we 've gone up to about a hundred
once you get used to cruising at seventy five eighty you actually when you go slower it feels like nothing
aaron that's a good one
and i took out my foot
and you 're supposed to actually you know if there's something on the road or some kind of an obstacle since everybody's riding together if you 're in front the guys in back can't really see when they 're coming up to it
so what you 're supposed to do is you 're something on the road on your side you 're supposed to put out your foot
and to show you know
you 're not supposed to lay
but apparently i calculated wrong
and i left my foot down too far
and i hit that damn otter
i almost broke my leg
yes
i almost broke my leg
it was really hard
we 're doing almost seventy miles an hour imagina te
the pain that he had
something laying there and then you kick it
it was like
and it was pretty big too
it was big
it was about like that
it was about like this
no it was about like that
huge sucker
really that big it was
yeah
well let me tell you
it didn't feel
jesus that thing hurt
oh my god
no we have we have such a good time
yeah
we have a great time going
everybody there's there's people in our age group
and there's people that are older than us
but the good thing is is we also have the radio on the on the thing so we 're listening to everybody talking on the c_b_s
so you these guys are all they got this one guy
this guy's a joke
he comes up he comes up with these things that you know you wouldn't have dreamed

whenever we have a hallowe'en party
whenever we have a hallowe'en san patrick day any
she got a green peluca
for san patrick day with her hair like that and then un collar en verde
yeah together
yes well what it was was like um like when it was the type of costume like when people get into a horse
and then the you 're the feet of the horse
and you 're in the horse but you 're also riding the horse
that's what type of it
it was a mix between
a half part of him was the devil and the other part was the the the angel
and and we had such a good time
oh
look who's home
oh look who's here
look who's here
we 're we were talking shit about you
our daughter got home wow
how nice
has what
the rice in the thing
the meat is over here
i think they wan+ na do a ride up to tennessee or something
oh yeah
yeah that was awesome
i know
it would have been nice for you to
yeah but there was another guy that was alone
you could+ a ridden
and you would have gone with us
you could+ a ridden
there was space
there was people that that went out
when we went we were just fresh into the club
what my dad
my dad's been in the club already four years
my dad my dad went into the club when i bought him his harley
i actually took him
because uh i asked the the people at the dealer
and they told me no go see these people
and we went there
and i took him
and you know when he first went in the first it was like you know
and he's uh he likes it
yeah
yes
and they they have they have a lot of people
it's a case right
i can
the typical type problems
yes
i don't like it
or and then the membership in this place is is junk money
and we have a club house
and they 're paying um
what do you call it
i think it's eight dollars a month is what it comes out to
that's nothing
and then there's people that complain that that's too much money
and i'm' like you know give me a break
you know that's that's not a lot of money
and you have a place to go to
it's every there every friday
and everybody that uh has a birthday they celebrate it over there
everybody you can take bocaditos pastelitos
you know everything the cake
and everybody sings happy birthday to that person
and you know they get all wild
and you know
and we have fun
no they do
so it's really nice
there's a lot of there's a lot of uh like we went to calle ocho this weekend
mama there's corn
did you saw it
and i believe we sold like six thousand five hundred dollars worth of beer
in calle ocho
yeah
right now i believe active active active members i 'd say there's about a hundred and forty that are active all the time going there
there's actually um i imagine i'm' member six hundred and something
yeah six eighty four
but what happens is is that a lot of the older people some have stopped going some don't go
and those are some of the issues
because what happens is these people get lost
and then they come back
and they don't pay membership for a couple of years
and then they come back
and they wan+ na pay their one year
and then like if
my dad was complaining
he said no i don't think they should do that
i say if you want your original number you have to pay back everything that you haven't been paying if you wan+ na keep your number or not we kill your number and you get a new number like the last person
he's a good person a very good person
when we went camping
and um
oh he went
but i i didn't go
she didn't wan+ na go
i didn't wan+ na go no
i was in i had my plans for the weekend
i had a bridal shower for that weekend on sunday
and then i said i'm' not gon+ na go you know early in a hurry to go camping and then pick up everything back
we had a good time
and then be all tired
they took karaoke

they did barbeque
everybody took their tents
they did a lot of things
and um one guy which wasn't a member of the club paid
your dad
uh hadn't gone to the club for like three years
and then showed up
because he wanted to go to the camping
he heard about it
and um uh the president told him you can't go you 're not an active member
then he goes well if i pay can i go
well he says yeah if you pay your membership you can go
he paid his his membership
and uh he showed up in a camper
and his camper got stuck in the back all the way in the back of the of the thing
it got stuck uh because it's humid over there
and it got stuck in the ground
yeah
and i said you know
and then he was complaining
because he pulled out a big uh one of those big screen type t_vs one of the projection types
and he was watching a movie
and everybody was singing and dancing
and we were laughing jokes
and he was complaining that the music was too loud
and i said look you don't make the rules we are the ones that planned on doing all of this if you don't agree with us that's fine then you can leave but you how you gon+ na be not even an active active member and then you gon+ na come and complain
snappy
and i and i him you know i don't really appreciate that i don't think we should allow people like that
we don't need people like that
you know
the other day he showed up at the club on friday
and uh he asked for water
and they gave him a bottle of water
give me a dollar
he goes oh you got+ ta pay for the water what do you think you know this isn't this isn't a not for profit organization yeah you got+ ta pay for your stuff here like everybody else does oh i didn't think that was right
give me a break man

*sastre8.csv*
well usually before you go to the bed you have to take him to do pee pee
yeah we did
but he still
but i guess he still got nervous when he was in the car
yeah
and he likes to stick his head out the window
no because we put it really high high enough for only his head
sometimes he might put his feet
but he can't get out
no it's about um
his hands could touch the top
and his it's as high it's high enough for him to put his hands
and do you hold him
yeah i hold him
but i think that they 're they 're high enough so that el no se
paula be careful
chill
be careful
yeah but i don't think
because he sees people all the time in the cars
but he never has seen a cat
mhmm
he's seen one before
well you never know
you have to be careful
i know
well tell me
oh
i don't know
it's like it's a passion already for me
i
did you play volleyball at the other school you were in
we did
it didn't work out
they didn't they changed the entire game
did they have a team there
in my old school
in
yeah they did
and you know i was so nervous
because i was because i was around so many like awesome players
she didn't make it
how come
i don't know
i think it was because she wasn't doing so good
i'm' not sure because maybe that's what they thought
maybe it was because
i don't know
maybe it was because that she had her grades low
because if you have an f or maybe more than one f you can't go into the team
ah
oh oh
maybe
but maybe that's not the reason
maybe they just didn't like her
or maybe they had better players
and when do you have to practice
we have to practice every day uh every week um school day
monday tuesday thursday and friday
i mean monday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday
monday tuesday thursday and friday at seven forty five
and wednesday
seven forty five in the morning
yes
and who's gon+ na take you
i will if nobody will take you
ah no
look i'm' not gon+ na get up that early
well there will be other girls that are on the team there waiting
she'll' be coming in at the same time
there are teachers coming in at that time already
oh they do
yeah but they 're not there outside
they 're inside preparing for school to start
inside the building
yeah
and we 're outside
and how do you get
through the office
or you go outside
well we go through the bus loop
and the parents drop us off there
and um
what's the bus loop
where they where the bus is for for the kids that go on the bus
they drop the kids off
where i leave you early every morning
uh
the same place i leave you

ah
oh no no no the other side where they all where all the buses are
oh in the back

jean and a polo shirt
we have we are gon+ na take the shorts and any type of shirt with our knee pads

in shape
he's not fat
nor is he skinny
he's just buff
no
i guess
sort of

*sastre9.csv*
mmhm
they do it every day
so when you come here don't be afraid if you hear it
because you know they 're practicing
yeah yeah they have to put these earphones
really
when
but it's not so loud because the range is all the way over there
yeah
which is great
i imagine if we were right there that would be a problem
yeah
but there's a lot of distance
so i don't think it's a problem
no no no it's not a problem
that's a good idea
yeah
but they have like like little dummies
yeah
and i think you 're supposed to like target them or something
that is the target right
yeah
yeah i used to do that
obstacle courses
oh my god
so i asked what was happening
and they said that the the the corrections is coming and also f_b_i
oh my goodness so we 're expanding
exactly
they 're very smart
and they all have background in what they do which is broadcasting videos
wow
and like actually recording
and editing and all that stuff
and it's gon+ na be great trying to learn from them because they 're all experts
so i'm' kind of looking forward to doing that
always learn from the experts
exactly
you can always become good yourself
well yeah they 're good trainers
so i i have faith that i'll' be able to do it eventually
so for instance i report to the lieutenant
and the whole place reports to the major
they report to different people
right
but he's the one in charge ultimately
oh
but everybody reports to her
but i i report to the to the lieutenant which is in the command staff
she's so beautiful
she's very young
because you know being a mother is no easy task
no that i know
but it's the best that anybody could experience in life
well you you have a lot of experience being a
you reared us all
yeah
you had six of us
and you put us all through school
i probably could never have done anything without you
thank you sis
you 're welcome mamita
and now you 're putting carmencita my daughter through school which is not an easy task either
and your children too
i tell you i think that now is is difficult
huh
and my daughter now is using you know
i got her the phone as a protection when she goes to school whatever she has to call but they 're text messaging
yeah now they don't even have to use your minutes
i have to check my son you know
you don't you haven't checked at all
so when do you plan to
no i'm' gon+ na ask ivan to do it for me porque
his his phone
but it takes time it's very tedious
yeah
really
it's it's already smeared
see look the number eight it's like it's all messed up
carmencita is really fast
carmencita is so fast on that on that email or the text messaging on her phone
she'll' answer faster to a text message than to answer her phone
i think so
i'm' serious
and they do this all day so now
and was telling me that since she is so close to that phone that another way to get to her so she behaves is say to her you know if you if you miss behave
because you know she has a tendency with her friends and everything
then what they 're gon+ na take the phone away when you get name from school you can't text message
and then then she says how quickly she's gon+ na be behave because she wants to do it
you know i wish that that would be a solution to the problem
but it's a a at least it's a suggestion
you know taking away
but what do you say
you know the the the
you you have psychology
what what what's the best way
my philosophy is totally different that
i believe in you know look for something that she's doing right
and reward her
yeah but what about the stuff that she's doing negative
some how
how do you take that away
you have to find a way to to either overlook it
and then reframe the whole circumstances
taking away taking away taking away
she was extremely nasty
that's not good
so we 're gon+ na punish her this weekend
she can't go out
she she could go out
but she can't be with her friends which is that's a real punishment
yeah that that to me that kind of punishment is like when you have finished all your recourses
to be with her friends not
to reframe the circumstances
you 've got+ ta find ways that she would wan+ na do it voluntarily to behave
to to get her clothing out
er finding ways
well i think the fact that she wants to be with her friends every weekend
and if and i'm' not letting her do it this weekend because she didn't behave
i don't think she'll' be she'll' be nasty again
i think that she will be
you do
ok let's try
let's use it as a as a test
try it try it
try it
i mean some times you have to use that kind of um you know training yeah
training
well many times i give him the silent treatment
and he he never gets the silent treatment porque se porta bien
i say yeah i am what do you expect you want me to have a smile on my face
mmhm
but we have a very good communication thank god
and he knows that i'll' you know do whatever i can to support him
yeah but like if he but if he answers you nasty
and he goes into his room
i say you know is that necessary
i say is that necessary
we we in this household believe in respect
and we try to work it out
a hundred and twenty god willing
thank you
and you know they go through some kind of osmosis when they hit sixteen
sixteen seventeen
so you know he said to me the other day oh you know mother you 're the greatest
that was nice
yeah
yeah
so i said to him talk to me in two more years
because you plan to what
well because they go through this osmosis
bring in the rains
then hey what what happened to the to most kids
exactly
no i'm' praying that it won't happen to my kid
i mean
uhuh
and a that seems to be a problem
yeah
did he when he went away you didn't see him
no no he was a he went to europe
yeah he used to have some friends
he did
yeah
but the the point to be made is thank god que era serio
mmhm
staying up late sixteen seventeen
and he went to religious school
but she's like on the computer
or watching t_v
that's ok
it's kid stuff
you know you know weekends whatever
and her friends are text messaging her
well i would say you know comes nine o'clock nine thirty because she is only eleven
so nine thirty is the latest
the phone gets shut off
the lights go off
the tv goes off
and everybody goes into the sac
it's time to go to sleep
i think that if you program kids like that early in life like my son right now
he automatically can he can't stay up
every day they do training at six in the morning
so it's a football team for the school
yeah
wow that's interesting
it's the first one in the nation
really
from a religious school
wow so that's good that he's part of it
he's thrilled
and
so what position is he in now
i don't know yet
but he's the guy that's supposed to stop them from moving
did they
he's like defence i think
yeah i don't know
he said first lineman
i think he told me first lineman
he says mommy you would be so proud of me
i know
i said i'm' proud of you know
exactly
because of course i don't want him to play
i know because you don't wan+ na him to break anything god forbid
but you know what
i don't wan+ na stifle him
swimming i i should have learned how to swim
swimming oh my god that's a perfect
i regretted so much
yeah that's the perfect thing to do when you get older
and you know
but when you get older you 're over the hill
perfect thing to do it when you get when you 're younger
yeah but yeah
i know but i'm' saying
she has to learn
let's talk a little bit about carmencita
mother insinuated that i should put her in camp this year
i don't think so
i told her i rather pay you and you take her
she can come with me any time
because
last year we had a great time
yeah
because mother was saying
we
because mother maybe because mummy no la puede cuidar
it's a conflict
yeah
the further away
what a stressful situation for that guy
he's in elementary school
and the girl is making advances towards him
you know what is the guy supposed to do
it's a it's a lot of stress for boys because these girls they don't know how to behave
they don't
yeah
and i leave at four which is great
i love the hours here
oh thank god
from eight to four
well you start early anyway
well there gon+ na be times i have to stay like when they 're doing stuff
you know i might have to stay
but that's not not every day
and sometimes when they have graduations i have to stay to help them whatever
yeah
but that's not every day
so like once every two or three months
thank god this is a blessing because people that are mothers
yeah
you can't you 've got+ ta be on the top of these kids
yeah
but today she wants to go to the park because i told her i let you go today to the park friday saturday and sunday you got+ ta be you know doing your you 've got when do you think you 're gon+ na finish your project with her

it's not too far from the house
maybe they can teach him how to be a cashier instead of a bag boy
but you want him to be a stock boy
whatever
i don't care
if he were if he did a cashier
i don't want him to be a stock boy
but cashier but you know

the bag boys

men of war

i'll' tell you that much
oh my god

yeah
nothing
that's not good
no that's terrible

so
it's very scary

really well you know what
now that luis is is behaving we should go back on the ocean because i don't think it's gon+ na be wild
i hate it

that's very good
so i need to today

yeah
they never wash the dishes unless of course i say you know what i'm' on strike y no voy a lavar hoy ahi que se queden las cosas
oh they don't like when i say that

to start he's gon+ na take one
and then maybe eventually he'll' have another one
yeah
so he'll' be back at it
yeah he's good at it
or how much he's gon+ na make
no he knows
when it comes to running a store and that's his expertise
that's his business
i mean i can
and people actually look for him to ask him his opinion
he's like a consultant
and i said you should charge
yeah
instead of giving free opinion
advice
yeah
yes he does
and the way he conducts himself people look up to him
yeah he is a very serious guy
yeah
he is serious
now he is more serious
no he is really serious
but yesterday we were watching t_v
was on he says did you know anything about publix
oh
and i said what
and then i told him i needed some ajax soap
and he went
and he got it for me
oh you know a relationship goes through a lot of different phases
you know
i'm' trying to sell i mean rent this house
i'm' going crazy with it
did you rent it or you didn't
no not yet
that's terrible
it's terrible
so anyway do you have your condo

i mean the only thing that you can really use es el balcon
so they are gon+ na put they are gon+ na put they are gon+ na put they are gon+ na put in your unit
they are gon+ na they are gon+ na fix your unit too
yeah the whole thing
i mean it's astronomical lo que estan cobrando
really
for the maintenance alone i'm' paying close to a thousand dollars
see that's what luis says
he says it's horrible
it's not worth it
listen if you wan+ na go see it it's a beautiful place sis
i know i know that he's gon+ na see one
we are supposed to go see one today at six
because he has to move
yeah i know
he because the because the owner can't afford it
it's in for closure
it is for closure
so many people are in for closure
so the owner but the owner hasn't told them anything
but he got the letter from the attorney
i don't know how many millions of rooms are gon+ na be in for closures
i don't know
so he's figured prize
listen if you wan+ na move in there i'll' give it to you cheaper
he says you know what because we could get it for a lot cheaper so called them
i'll' ask him today
but what happened
that house is beautiful
he he is not he is not retired yet
he should
i know
if i if i was his age and his money i would have retired
he wanted to be this
he is almost sixty years old already
how old is he like
sixty three i think
so he should retire and be happy
i think that at sixty five you can retire with a better income
who cares about the income
he he he he is fine
he should live he should live
well this is what this is what he told me
if things would get rough where he is working now
then he would retire
he would give them their working papers
and he would retire
right now you know what
they look up to him
no if they respect him that's good
they respect him
and you know what
when you retire many times you vegetate
you are throwing the towel
yeah
that's what i don't wan+ na do
well you are never gon+ na retire because you are gon+ na live a hundred and twenty
and then you have carmencita's all of middle school elementary
so one more year
i'm' i'm' getting this adventure now yeah
then you have middle school
and then you have high school
well i have this invention going that hopefully they will bite
and if they bite you know i will have an income there
praise god
a steady income yeah thank god
but you are gon+ na have like a your like a warehouse or something like that
no i don't wan+ na do that
i just wan+ na sell my ideas
sell it
are you just gon+ na get the royalties
manufacture it
just royalties
that's good sis
if they like my ideas
people will buy it
it's not something that er
yeah do you remember that that stupid guy i was recently dating
he was saying that he uses gloves
yeah
i know it's gon+ na sell
now let's see if the guy bites
he wrote to me
but he's not the only one
no this is the second one i'm' approaching
and what did he say
he's a a a big supplier to big big stores
he manufactures all kinds of stuff
so
and what did he say finally
i don't know i'm' waiting for his response a ver que me dice
anything that you decide to do sis is very intelligent
i i'm' banking on that sis
i really am banking on that because i like to see you know something that i do
to flourish
to flourish
and that everybody will benefit from it
you are very good
is gon+ na work for the rest of his life
yeah
because of the insurance
yeah the insurance
oh yeah man
i went on cobra
mmhm
it was it was ridiculous
it was about a thousand dollars for carmencita and i
a month
so how do you do it so that you can retire
you really can't retire
no you can't retire
and mm i don't want him to retire either
yeah
most housewives would say that about their husbands
you'll' drive me crazy
go to work honey
go to work honey
yeah he'll' drive me nuts
yeah
you know
that's er
but he's a good guy
no no he is
yeah
he is
you know like luis you know luis just if you just feed luis and give him his television he is happy
right
they are quiet men
yeah
and i don't really have to feed him
he'll' say what do you want me to go get you
so it's not like i have to cook
that's a blessing
exactly
just for that keep him around
yeah
exactly
no
the other day he was shocked that i said no i'm' gon+ na make you filet mignon you are are you feeling ok
yeah
yeah
yeah
so we'll' see lo que
yes he is
he is a nice guy
yeah you gave me the letter yeah
oh really
sure
she needs them now
she needs them now for her no se que
you know i think this is so ridiculous
she had a good over a hundred hours of vodka
oh please
so i made that up
and i'm' making him sign it
that's all
yeah
oh please
so
oh please is right
they don't even you know how to even feed themselves
i don't like this looseness
i don't like it either sis
trust me it's the hardest job
it's very very hard
that's why i rather her being with you for the summer
yeah
you know i figure i can give you maybe two hundred dollars a month
do you think is that too little
yeah
well whatever
and then and then and then two hundred dollars a month for you and two hundred dollars to to do whatever
the thing is
so it's four hundred dollars a month
two hundred dollars for the expenses
you know the food
well no two hundred dollars for her expenses for the food for the movies wherever you go
yeah
i think two hundred is ok
or we could make it less than what we spend
and then we make adjustments
ok or we could that way
i think that way is better
you could just you could maybe that's another way of doing it
yeah
i give you the money for you
and then whatever you spend you tell me
right
like we do with the stuff
we put it on a yeah in a list
and then do that way
alright that would work
that will work
you know empezo
mother told her or she told her
did mother bring it up or carmencita brought it up
no she brought it up
no but i don't prefer it
and i'm' the mother
yeah
if we can keep it controlled sis
no no you got+ ta
yeah
oh yeah that'll' be good
excellent
it would be great if you can
it's a lot of work
well
but we can we can
we can
no she's grounded on saturday too so
i don't like that
but i would
i 'd say let let's finish this quickly and maybe we can lift it
now that's how i would work it
you see what i'm' talking about
psychology
yeah
that that's that's turning it around
well maybe that would work
you know
right
you know no
exactly
ok so that'll' do good
i mean she deserved she deserved
well i 've never in eleven years i 've never punished her
sure this is my first time punishing her
but she deserves it she deserves it
she has a big mouth
that's a good idea sis
yeah
that's what i said at the beginning
going yeah
well she wants some
she wanted it on thursday today
really
oh my god
it's like a fad right know with the kids
and she wanted right away
she said that she's not gon+ na give you hard time ni nada
ok good
i'll' say you know what i'll' go outside
she was so good when they were pulling out that tooth
or they were filling it they were filling it
she's big now
now she's by herself
oh yeah no she's very smart
she's brilliant
she's smart kid
and she's very well loved
they love her
i said ok
doctor loves her
i said why don't you let me touch it
no because she said the last time i touched her i it
what
i did
all of her teeth
but why you go back into her mouth and do it again
i said i said let me touch them let me see how
she is growing up
you know what these things really do happen
of course
you know and and
you said only in the protection of the lord are we safe
moses i love you

that's where i was yesterday
i went to a fish restaurant
mm i love
but they would they would
yeah but i eat fish
i mean you can have what ever you want
but i mean i was just eating fish

*zeledon1.csv*
mmhm
ok
wow
ok
ok
we 've always gone every year so
oh wow
wow
ok
mmhm
blah
wow
oh
i 've i 've never heard of you know colombians in l_a
oh
ok
ah ok ok
it's like the tie
there's no other way around it
mmhm
but it was tough
the the first year i wanted to to go back to venezuela you know
i didn't like it at all
the first year was really hard
no obviously because you 're used to it
same thing happened to me
because you don't know nobody and it and it's hard
like i 've i 've seen here it's hard to make friends
it's hard to like to have good friends that you can you know
mmhm
rely on
it's like these people that work with you and that's about it
when you go to school these people may leave
these people that are here you 're not gon+ na see them you know
ever again i know
and in may instead in venezuela when once you start your career that's gon+ na be the people you 're gon+ na be for five years together
so it's like you know you go to their houses you go to
exactly i was talking you know it's funny because i was talking to my boyfriend last night about this
mmhm
he just graduated from you know college
he's an architect
in colombia
he graduated in colombia
ok
and the funny thing is that i was talking to him because i was telling him how different it is you know from colombia here
right
because i had the experience as well
right
you know i i i was there for two years
ok
and for those two years it was the same people
if anything people just you know dropped off or they filled courses or they filled the semester or whatever it was
exactly
right there it is exactly
but every semester you saw the same people the same classes same schedule the same days
the same people
right right
it did it wouldn't it didn't change at all you know what i mean it
i know
and here you jump from one group of people to another
right
you really don't
no in the other the other subject that i'm' taking the other class is like i don't know nobody
i don't know their names
i don't know where they work
yeah i i guess the difference between here and there is that there you actually get to you know
i have no idea
you actually make friends like real friends
exactly right right
because you know those are important years of your life number one
exactly
no you even work together
number two you 're sharing the same you know career
same ideas
exactly experiences
same experiences exactly
i even work with my my like my close friends
and you you actually you know get good friends
right
here it's uh almost impossible
yeah it's TRUE
because you'll' have different schedules you know from every every other person
i guess when you 're gon+ na the career career you know in the you know not the core you know classes maybe i don't know
not uh not even because you know what i think anyway i mean
in my case when when i go to dental school
mmhm
yes it's gon+ na be much more you know um challenging
and you know i i guess the classes are gon+ na be mandatory for everyone at you know specific scheduling
right
right
but i don't think that it's gon+ na be so like
the classes number one are not gon+ na be small guaranteed
mmhm
whereas in you know colombia venezuela they 're smaller
right
and you you know the amount of the number of people that go into the class
exactly
and number two it's not you know personalised
mmhm
you 're never gon+ na get to have that relationship specially with your teachers
right
where in colombia or venezuela you you know just latin america countries in general you you do
exactly yeah yeah
exactly
you know what i mean
and you know it's funny because i was talking to him last night about that and he was all because he's moving here
yeah
and here is more you know people is like you know competing competing
plus that fact that here plus that fact that here most of the people you know we 're in the in a country where everything is you know consuming and consuming and you know
time flies
mmhm
you really don't have time for yourself so
exactly
what happens is that everyone has debts
everyone has you know bills to pay
mmhm
everyone has to take care of their own stuff
right
everyone works in other words
mmhm
in colombia in venezuela you depend on your parents
exactly
and your daddy is paying for all your career and everything that you know if comes along the way with within those years
that's TRUE and all you do is study and that's it
you know that that you 're still in school and your career
exactly right
if you wan+ na go out
if you wan+ na eat somewhere
if you wan+ na buy this
mmhm
materials you know instruments
mmhm you don't need to worry no
tuition everything you you you don't worry about anything but studying
mmhm exactly that's TRUE
so you do have time for yourself
and plus you know that's why everything's more you know personalised
whereas here the schedules might be different for everyone
right
because of jobs and then
no and people here they have two jobs it's crazy
er for me i work from seven thirty in the morning
mmhm
till four in the afternoon
right
that's only because i'm' now in in school
right
before when i wasn't in school yet i would work twelve hours
from seven thirty in the morning
wow
till eight nine p_m
wow
it's crazy
it's crazy
mmhm
why
because she deals with more like paperwork
mmhm
right
i and you we both deal with people
mmhm
right
every day all day long
exactly right
it's to deal with mmhm
rules and issues for you for your children and me for my patients
right
you know and on top of that it's just the stress of having to deal with with you know people's
mmhm
complaining
emotions complaints
that's right
you know
sarcasm um attitudes
because people give you attitudes and everything
and you have to learn to deal with that
right
so i think it's even more tiring
it's more of a difficult job no i i i don't wan+ na
right of course no dealing with people face to face is like is hard
it's not easy
especially like me it's the kids plus the parents plus the you know the staff in there
the people the directors everyone you know
exactly
mmhm
ok
it is you know
it's nothing
you 're actually just you know doing whatever
mmhm
yeah nice when you 're the customer it's good that you know that
mmhm
they say and they publicize that you know the customer is always right
but when you 're the owner the business owner
or when you 're the the the the employer or the employee and this whole the customer's always right theme
mmhm
right
you know it's a pain in the ass
because you know you get you get treated like you 're nothing
right
people people forget that you know people don't even know that i actually own the place
exactly
so they all treat me when the customers don't know they'll' treat me as if i was you know one of those stupid little girls
because that's how they treat them
wow
and i 've had you know several problems with several customers
because it's ridiculous that it because of the customer always being right
you you let someone disrespect you
exactly
forget it
for me to me respect is always first
and what do you do like
no i confront them like
when they
this um last sunday what happened was that the customer walks in right
so so i you know i took care of him whatever
i did his sandwiches
and he was with i guess his parents
ok
two elderly people that's like a couple husband and wife
ok
i'm' guessing it's his parents whatever
ok
so um they walk in whatever
i took care of them i
you know i made them sandwiches
and then we used to give out our courtesy cups for water
mmhm
just because it it doesn't happen in every subway
right
it it all depends on the owner
ok
if the owner wants to do it or the manager you know
mmhm
if they approve it
right
and what was happening is that people weren't you know taking water
they were actually taking soda from the fountain machine
oh
and that's a loss for us in money daily
right
so what we did was we you know we weren't we weren't um gon+ na give out courtesy cups any more
right
so this man comes you know last sunday whatever
when i go to charge him he asks me for three courtesy cups
and i tell him i'm' because he was used to going whatever and getting the cups
and i tell him sorry sir but we 're no longer giving you know courtesy cups
because we 've had several issues with several clients
mmhm
and we 're not doing it anymore
and then so he responded to me he said
let me just remember like the exact words
he goes to me he goes so what am i supposed to do drink water out of my hands
like with that you know with sarcasm
right right right
and i was already upset at something
so i went off on him
i told him well if you wan+ na drink water out of your hands like an animal go ahead be my guest that's not my problem i don't care now if you wan+ na drink like a normal human being you know like an educated person you buy one of these cups which are you know the paper cups these paper cups are the ones that you have to purchase for soda
just ask for a soda right up
right
mmhm
and i'm' gon+ na have to charge you as if you were buying a soda
right
ah this is ridiculous
i told him yeah it might be ridiculous to you but you know what the word courtesy means that's up to us if we wan+ na give it for free or not
exactly it's uh optional
it's optional
right
it's not like subway is obligating us to give out courtesy
because the word says it all courtesy cups
i had it out with the guy i had it out with the guy
how old was he like
he was like a teenager
what
he was like a teenager or something
no he was a grown up and like forty seven year old fifty year old man
oh my gosh
i can't believe
and that's when i told him that i didn't appreciate him disrespecting me that i didn't you know appreciate neither was i gon+ na tolerate his sarcasm
right
because i find it ridiculous that you would talk to you know a a working person an employee like that
right
and then he asked me to speak he wanted to speak to the manager and i told him that i was the owner so then there was nothing he could do about it
exactly well that's good at least
and i told him it's either you learn to respect and accept you know the things that are going on i was actually pretty nice you know to you when i tried to tell you that we had no cups any more you know i'm' actually giving you an explanation when i don't have to give you an explanation if i don't wan+ na and you respond to me you know aggressively and with sarcasm i'm' not gon+ na tolerate that if you like that you can stay you can buy a cup and you know you 're more than welcome to be our client we actually appreciate your business whatever but if not there's a million subways out there if you really like subway you can find another one
mmhm to explain right
right
mmhm
oh my god i can't believe it

*zeledon11.csv*
um you know this is a picture of the parking garage that you can easily tell
uh there's g_c up top p_c on the left side book store on the top side as well
it's i mean this is pretty readable right
this isn't some kind of disgusting explanation
this is a map of parking garage
yeah i mean just you can orient them
all right
now the next one
um the next one after that
next one
yeah all right
i'm' gon+ na ask you if you were standing there
were you standing at point one
yes i was standing at point one when the police found us so and so on
during the incident ok uh when we were found were you standing at point one on the third floor
that's where we were standing
it's imperative that we make that clear because the next page
so this so this is so this is g_c right
on the next page you'll' see it
on the next page you'll' see it
um it's imperative you say it because on the next page then he's got an option
where were you standing you know right before you came up
and i 've got pictures for each and every one of those
nice
ok
um except for location two
i have location nine
but if it's location two it'll' be beautiful because i'll' be it will say the building
what what did you see
what did you hear
did you hear it over there
why didn't you check over there
i mean
yeah
then i think the last page i 've got is the on the fifth floor
we should+ a we we should ask ah we should ask this guy a question in spanish
we should ask them before and after
yeah yeah we should switch
we should we should say all the main questions in english all the nice questions in spanish
how do you how do you say how do you how would you say like officer in spanish
i mean that sounds
yeah
because i mean like if it's a detective you just say like you know detective
make it sound better
uhuh
because if you it sounds very uh
actually you don't wan+ na tell someone you know in fascist argentina
you know like that's
that's or in fascist chile
yeah actually like uh
you don't call your best friend oficial
like that's
did you know where the term fascism comes from
no
like i was watching ah rome with my dad
mmhm
that that mini series that was like well it was like it was like a like a show like a full length h_b_o show
and um there was a there was a staff like a huge staff with ah the eagle
right
ok
which is like the it's like
i forgot the the name for the the actual emblem
but it's ah it's it's it's some some particular thing uh that signifies the legion
you know that signifies the caesar
and it's called the
the oh ok
so so like that that staff is a symbol of state so fascism
the statism yeah that's
yeah
caesar that's awesome
so yeah
yeah so like he told me about that
i was like yeah it's pretty cool like i didn't i didn't know that
um
yeah so
now i just have to start calling you fascist instead of a communist which is ridiculous and stuff
it's like
boggle my mind
there's no difference
that's the thing
like like like like if
yes there is
as my as my friend always brings up it's like if you take like the the two polar extremes are curved you know
mmhm
so at the at the high point of the curve they are at opposite ends
but as you get lower on the curve or higher on the curve they start to converge
that's an interesting way to look at it
because think about it you know
fascist italy and communist soviet union not that different you know
but they fought
so i mean
you know what i mean
so it's what's the difference
you know it's it's a it's a state governed
so it's the name of the brand man so
yeah it's like it's like government
yeah well it's not state it's government you know
it's it's management
i mean yeah it's whatever you know
so
i shot an a_k yesterday
i was gon+ na ask you that
i was gon+ na ask you about the about the gun
what were you gon+ na ask me
that was delicious
that was amazing
um i have a bruise on my shoulder right now from the rifle that i shot
you ever seen the movie enemy at the gates
yes
you know the rifle he has
yes
this super accurate gigantic man rifle he's got
mmhm
i shot that
a man rifle yeah
destroyed my right destroyed my shoulder
nice
um it literally felt like the second i pulled the trigger there was this small like gnome right at the hundred yard mark who ran over and then punched me in the shoulder and ran back behind the target
nice nice
um
red like from here to here
nice
it's beautiful
dave shot it one time
and then he's got this black and blue bruise
nice
um
what's that called the like the the
recoil
recoil
i was gon+ na say backlash
yeah
but it's essentially the same
it's pretty much the same thing
but when you 're talking about guns it's recoil
right
after that i shot the a_k like maybe a hundred times
and that that was nothing
that was nothing compared to that first rifle that was nothing
yeah
you have to see you have to see lord of war because lord of war like the centre piece weapon in lord of war is the a_k the kalashnikov you know
yeah
like he starts he goes into this monologue about like all the benefits of of a kalashnikov
and it's it's like it's the weapon
you know how they market
and it's like the
i mean i'm' sure you know this
but do you know how they marketed the kalashnikov
no
the first time around
um the first time they marketed it they said i can clear a soccer field with four hundred men like that are that four hundred men with ten of mine
give me ten kalashnikovs and ten men and i will clear a football field with four hundred people
jesus
how long they asked
four seconds
four seconds
what do the other guys have
well nothing
they have rocks
you have four seconds to throw a rock
you know you never
you know i realized yesterday why people don't use full auto um when they shoot
and it's because i heard someone shoot an a_k full auto thirty rounds
it took about four seconds
the entire magazine gone
it was like one two three four done
it was a whole magazine
they 've now wasted thirty rounds of ammunition
it probably cost them twenty dollars in four seconds in four or five seconds
yeah
i mean if you have your target in place i mean you wan+ na unleash
do it
go full auto you know but
that's why they use three round burst
um that's that's why they use three round
and the three round burst is pretty fast
it's
but at least with three round you hit in the same place
yeah
i was shooting it shot by shot with the kalashnikov at um twenty five yards
this was the spray you know
this was the area i was hitting
it's not an accurate gun at all
the other rifle on the other hand is
the only problem is after you shoot it once you don't wan+ na shoot it again
so the the first time you shoot you hit dead on the mark
but the next time you shoot you kind of like anticipate
and you start getting nervous like right right
this is what's so funny
i'm' holding it
and i can see my breath moving the end of the gun little by little
hmm
and then i put my finger on the trigger
and i know it's gon+ na hurt me
and then you see my rifle start doing this
pretty funny
it's an experience man
you should come
did you did you fire anything smaller than a rifle or
um no i i fired a really crappy um rifle
david's rifle
it's a twenty two
it sounds like
it's
so so it fits david's personality
you know just kind of like
oh yeah actually yeah it kind of does
um
yeah i i i asked carlos
and he said he says he's down to to um to oversee today's proceedings with todd and stuff
interesting ok
um
i think i think he's gon+ na offer a good good perspectives like good notes
like i didn't talk to him too much yesterday about it
i just brought it up but so
you know i figure for the first hour we can um we can just get the questions out of the way
it it might take an hour
just get all write down all the questions all of them everything we can come up with
and then we have two hours to kind of practice
yeah
yeah we can role play
we can you know
yeah
he can he can be he can be a character you know and just
yeah
he can be the officer
you can be the officer
so
and he takes three different shots at him
i mean he can he can lie the first time or tell the truth the second time
are you gon+ na turn off your thing
my what
your little cube
no no i'm' charging it
oh ok
like a yeah
i got nervous today man
i went i went upstairs
i need to get there early on wednesday
because i was like
like i got a like i got a little nervous you know
so
i mean i think it's just jitters that are gon+ na go away within like five minutes
i just need to like breath in the musk of that room you know
you 're uh
you 're talking about the uh the jitters you get when you go up there
yeah like just the
it happens to me every single time
yeah
i saw the woman
i saw i saw the director
you saw the dark sith lord
she looked she looked she looked ok
she's
she looked like somebody that's not gon+ na
i i didn't see like i didn't see the dark force
it's like i don't want anything from her i just
i i didn't see it either until we sat down
she just goes
what's her name samantha
she she goes up to samantha
and she's like no he's i'll' take him
like what
and then when we sat down she she started telling me some stuff
she seemed ok
and then i started asking questions asking questions
and she
and then give me an answer
and then can i keep going
and then i 'd ask another question
she 'd give me an answer
it's really weird
she 'd give you an answer
she's
in that in that face
or wouldn't give you an answer
yeah like in that face well she would give me an answer sometimes
she would also use that face to dodge me
so she kind of like her face gets stone cold when she's trying to dodge people
mmhm
i i i think i think i i think we need to kill her with kindness you know just
oh yeah
it's like hello you know how's it going
i mean like you know very
you know i haven't i have no problem being kind to the police
i mean kind to whoever
because this is all about survival so
survival i will l will like i will shake hands
i will like do whatever it takes
because when it's all said and done you know i can hate whoever i wan+ na hate at twelve o'clock at one o'clock
at twelve o'clock
i'm' twenty four years i'm' twenty five
i'm' twenty five years old
like i can hate whoever i want for the rest of my life
like these three hours are are big
so
i mean i'm' not gon+ na i'm' not gon+ na be anything above and beyond courteous above and beyond respectful
i mean i that that's that's my main thing
i wan+ na be respectful
because because again like whether whether the the officers
i mean i'm' i'm' i think she deserves respect just as an individual
but whether the officers deserve respect or not is not a matter of intrinsically
it's a matter of in the proceedings
the proceedings have to be treated with respect
because given that it's so wishy washy given that it's so shifty and unstructured respect is gon+ na factor in
yeah
you know if we 're aggressive if we 're you know assholish if we 're whatever then
yeah you got+ ta
yeah
can you can you just if possible can you just like tap me or something
don't make it too public
but just do something when i'm' getting aggressive
because i know that when i question people maybe the first fifteen minutes is good but i i i do feel like i'm' hunting them down when i get the answer i want
maybe i can crack my fingers or something
ok
just just watch for that
watch me crack my fingers
and just calm down
ok
um and again like like it'll' probably be you ask a question
and then i ask a question
and todd asks a question
i don't think you 're gon+ na you 're gon+ na be allowed to ask like consecutive questions
it's gon+ na you me todd you me todd like that
ok
so which is good
because then you know you 're thinking about your next question
we have time
so
i was looking at this trash can
and then i'm' thinking like uh
it looks like r2-d2 doesn't it
it looks like r2-d2 yes
yes it looks like you know like a a coked out you know
a coked out drunk
like yeah like technology has has has uh passed him by
he's a you know he's an inebriated
he's just like washed up machine
and then he's just like he's vacant like his whole face is just like
he's just
he's missing like half his operating system
he's like he's just like beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
he hasn't had an upgrade in years
i mean just look at this guy
yes
but yeah
but i think i think i had in spanish
it's like like
i mean how do you say
you know it's but it's like
like the the that compound in english
you know it's just like you 're not gon+ na find that in spanish
trash can
trash and it's a can
you know it's trash can
like in in a in a in a in spanish it's just like no it's like it's one item
it's basurero
it's just that's what it
you know that's actually something i like about spanish
um it really combines a lot of words
it's not um of the
it's just d+ el
that's right
slam them together d+ el
yeah
so much more efficient i think
yeah but in but in but in english you have you have what they what i mean what i'm' gon+ na call right now like like prepositional adverbials becoming becoming adjectives
so you have uh again like a professor of french say french professor
whereas in spanish you don't have that
that's right you don't
there is that there is no
there's always de
if you say if you say profesor frances
it means a french like literally from france
yes yeah
yeah
yeah so that it's it's disambiguated
in english you have that ambiguous ambiguous possibility because of the the way you can put place um uh modifiers
you know that's actually that's actually another reason why i prefer to write in english as to writing in spanish
because english does allow you to be a little ambiguous which means you can have so many more double meanings at times
and makes it interesting
told me that they actually want disambiguation like so
oh well uh i'm' talking about like when i write like poetry or music
ok right
no when it comes to journalism i want crystal clear
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
in that case spanish would be a little better but it's longer
little things like that really lengthen an article
you don't know how many times i'm' like like the professor of france french professor
yeah
ok
that's it that's it
yeah this see i don't imagine this r2-d2 having beeps
i i see it having like a like a
nice
um man like i 've i 've been like nauseous all day
like just thinking about all this crap
like i don't have my test results yet so
you know like
like i i was actually telling marta that like you know the way the way i cope with any of this
she still doesn't know about wednesday
but the way i cope with any of this is that i i take it
how do you not tell her
because there's not point
no i ok i know there's no point
and you being a man of efficiency will obviously not tell her if there's no point
yeah yeah
like i told her
you know when she finds out she's gon+ na wan+ na kill you
i don't know if she's ever gon+ na find out
you know it's
i mean unless like i get screwed over you know
i guess
yeah i'll' i mean i'm' just gon+ na really down play it
like because like my whole idea is that
it's always no big deal
it's always no big deal you know
like had she been here had she been here i would have told her
because i told her about the event
i told her that evening i spoke to her
i was like oh like this shit happened and whatever
and she's like oh that really sucks you know
but i just never brought it up again you know
like i never told her when i got hearing notice
i never told her about any of that you know
um
she's gon+ na bring it up on wednesday afternoon hey you never told me what happened with that
kidding
she what
you know like you 're kidding right
you are joking
do do you like uh do you like this picture
that's nice yeah
yeah that's good
let's see it again
actually i have my own copy
you have your own copy
get over there
we should we should number these like
that that's actually what i was gon+ na tell you right now
i'm' gon+ na start numbering them now
this brings me to my the the the topic that i 've been wanting to to talk about
i have this uh when i went to
topic that you wanted to talk about
one thing what i ever wan+ na talk about
always
um one of the days that i went to gordon beach like
this isn't you know even supreme
but
no no it's just nice
but don't you love this picture
don't you love this picture
what do you see
i feel that's a door
that's the the main like entrance door
yeah
and what's interesting i i will ask what did you see
and i i took these two pictures very quickly
hello
hi
ok
fine
ok good
ok
ok
ok
ok thanks
ok
there you go
you a little less nervous now
a little bit
all right check it out
i i took these quickly enough so that i could ask him to describe what he sees through that window
mmhm
and this is what's actually in that window
so he's like i see a light there might be a car there's another car um um can you please be more descriptive could you tell me the colour of the car could you tell me which way the car is going could you tell me if it's the front or the back of the car tell me all these descriptions
mmhm
and i'll' be like well this is what it actually looked like and these are the things you did not include so if you say that you saw us throwing something that's that's funny there could+ a been a man standing right out there you couldn't see him so
that's anyway
yeah we should start numbering them
um if you don't mind helping me
i brought a pen
sure sure
um i'm' gon+ na i'm' gon+ na number um
let me figure out
this is your first one too
with these two people
um see the things are not in order
so i we can just tell from the photo where each one is
so
ok
let's ah let's just try this
put the map upside down
if you don't mind actually this might be easier for you or for me
i'm' just gon+ na
i'm' just gon+ na put these close to each other kind of like if i'm' putting a map on paper
um this one's closer
yeah let's just number one set
and then we'll' just mimic the other side
yeah yeah
that's what we 're gon+ na do
but anyways that picture that you took um like ah that brings me up to like that one day that i went to go to
and uh and i i remember this long lost like spanish term you know which was uh which was vacilar
have you have you ever heard that
i 've never heard of vacilar te
no
oh man like that is like such an awesome word
ok
it also means to have fun
so it could just mean like it's like it's like being merry you know or having fun having a good time like living it up
you know
that's funny i always confused being merry with being married
sorry what did you say
no no no being merry
what
so unlike you
it's not just visually
it's not it's because you see you can't directly translate it into checking it out to checking out like i checked out that girl
you can't say like i checked her
it's not quite the same
it's i am i there there's an aspectual there's an aspectual component
aspectual means like there's a there's a it's a it's more complex
so it's not just i went to the store it's like i have gone to the store
so you have the complexity of of perfective tense
and i am in the process of checking her out
so i am taking her in
it's like i am drinking i am drinking her sight visually
i am drinking the sight of her
wow
how would you use that
i mean that's really direct you know
that's ah
you know it's like
that's
it's like
but it's just like i i took her in
i didn't just check her out
it's a it's a it's a it's a renewing process of checking out
it's like checking out for an extended period of time
taking it all in
you know i can't imagine that that has the same effect in english
i mean
no no it doesn't
that's one thing
yeah
i'm' inspecting you
yeah there's no there's no
that wow
so there isn't that um that authoritative
no no no it's very it's very like it's very fluid you know
very like just take it in you know
it's it's like a full it's like it's like a it's like opening up the lense you know like to you know the slow slowest shutter speed
just letting letting the entire image you know like materialize you know just
it's
yeah
it's it's a it's a it's a serious word
that's new in my vocabulary
that sticks
i mean like like i'm' obsessed with it
i'm' just like like there's no equivalent
i mean you have to say i'm' scanning you
checking you out i'm' taking you in
taking the sight of you in
you know i am comparing you to like the you know the schema that i have in my head
all these things are contained within that one word
what brought this up at
no no no like i'm' i'm' i'm' driving on down the street
and i see this woman you know
it's like then i just like turned
it's like it's like this word just a word you know it's for this you know for like the type of
because like we checked her out on the way there and on the way back like
because we had to use the u-turn
i mean i got i got the full view just the full view
it's like
it's like i'm' i 've taken this woman in
my god
like like i understand
you know like various aspects of her of her of her personality you know like you know visually visually
purely visually
of her visual personality
that's that's the best euphemism i 've ever heard
visual persona i 'd say visual persona
like
i mean there's a difference in persona and personality
but again like and then like you can turn it you can turn it right around and make it a make it an activity
yeah the verb
which means like in in in a general sense you know life has to be enjoyed
you know like take in life
you know take in a a joyous activity you know
so
that's that's that's interesting
i wonder if there's some
i mean you would know this better than i would if there's something in history something that happened that somehow brought those two words together if it was fun to inspect
what was when was it fun to check out
just had natural curiosity you know
so it's of curiosity
yeah
americans have no curiosity
the thing is again if i i do i do find myself victim to to or subject to to that that clinical approach to vision
what do you mean
you know vision like the my my visual filter is is a is a clinical mechanism
it's a it's an inspection mechanism
and you lose some of that pleasure
you know like the there's there's pleasure in sight
you know like i look i look at a mountain side and like there's no pleasure
you know it's it's like a shape
you know it's it's shapes
um and and the only thing i'm' trying to do is figure out how it all works together
what
why
i don't i don't get
i don't get that that hit you know
but like remembering that word and remembering and like and like i think like that that doesn't happen to me with women at least
you know like certain things certain things like really catch my eye you know
you need to take a photography class with a pretentious professor
you need to take a photography class
it makes you see things differently
make you see your shapes differently
if you take the right professor um this guy ted mackenzie
not that you would ever take his class
but if you audit it or
yeah valerie valerie's told me about him like
she was she was friends with him
valerie
um ex girlfriend
you met her
i met her
i think like
yes
couple of times yeah couple of times at least couple of times yeah
yes
stuff like that yeah
yes i remember
she brought the
actually i said the same thing
you brought it up the same way
you 're like you met her many times
um well let's see
help me out here
this is uh thing
this is three right
i'm' looking at it upside down
the three
this is close enough to be three
this would have to be four
this would have to be this would have to be four as well
this is kind of the general area
um
ok this is definitely a three
ok
you know how to say hairline in spanish
i forgot
mmhm
hold on
trying to think
trying to remember like my dad shouting at my mom when i was like six years old me estoy volviendo calvo cono
no hairline
about hairline
um
yeah
to the slides like going further in you know so
we 've been over this
didn't we talk about this at dunkin donuts
what about it
i think you asked me how to say hairline in spanish
and i was like i don't know but i know about the entrances
and you were like yeah yeah las entradas
yeah
no i don't remember
i could+ a sworn you brought it up then
um yeah
i have no idea how to say hairline
is there a spanish dictionary over here
look it up
we do not we do not have a spanish dictionary
not that i know of
american dictionary
i'm' not gon+ na look for it
no
don't worry about it
but uh
hairline
i have no idea
or bald
there's got+ ta be some base term
mmhm
i don't know
so this is three
and we'll' say this is
this is kind of the same area as three
this would have to be four
so you 're at three two threes
yeah because i'm' i'm' doing general area
ok
i had to make these numbers big enough so that they could see it
i see what you 're saying
so
so you 're grouping it area-wise ok
yeah
and then i'm' gon+ na be like so where were you standing in these two do you remember what it looked like
because this is what it looked like from that direction
and i can pick
this
that's why i don't i don't want him to be like i was standing in three but a little bit more to the right ok well here you go
yeah this is the benefit of here where like we present this once
there's no need to to do it over and over again
do this over and over and over again yeah
what did chuck nerris say
um he didn't say anything
i mean i told him like you know we we should get together after it's all said and done
i mean he wrote me the two letters and stuff
he wrote me i mean one of them's gon+ na turn into the other one
i guess i'll' keep i guess i'll' get to read them
because i 've never read like any letter that anyone has ever written me so
really
yeah these like recommendations they 're always like sealed so
by the way don't think that you 're gon+ na get away with taking away the poetry book
it goes right back on my piano when you 're done
no no it's it's in it's in my car
i noticed
i noticed it
sat down at the piano yesterday
mmhm
and i was like i'm' gon+ na play hey where the is my poetry book
it hasn't been it hadn't been touched though
i left it on the same page
i have been reading it
really
yes
since since i showed you that poem
because i
a while back yeah
because it's
i mean i showed you that poem
and then like i left it on that page
actually i tend to get books and leave them exactly as they are um which is probably why my book collection is like
i don't know if you 've noticed this
it doesn't have creases
my books don't have creases
because if i find i'm' on a certain page and i find them in a certain condition i leave it as it is so
i i i damage my books
i almost get like a certain joy out of it you know
like a slight a slight damage you know like
why
why
it's been read
it's been
nah
it's been
i mean i mean i if i had to choose like if i could keep it in perfect form
but i like to bend my books back
i like to write in them take notes carry them everywhere
and if i have big cargo pockets put them in big cargo pockets
so
this is gon+ na be in as well
i'm' pretty sure we can have uh two pictures for every area so he can't say you know it was a little bit north of that i'm' not gon+ na fall into your trap
mmhm
you know
you 're trap
um this is
yeah see we 're the ones setting a trap
oh yeah we 're
we 're trappists
we 're absolutely trappists my friend
fur trappers yeah
yeah we 're trapping police
yeah
a nice way to get rid of him
yeah don't ask your questions too quickly
like like rapid fire like four questions you know
and that's just like that's it's just gon+ na make him an enemy
you know and it's gon+ na make the the
you know we want
isn't it disgusting that if we make one the enemy the other one goes to like really
worse
work like this
i i want them to be i wan+ na be as respectful as possible
because i wan+ na give them no reason
they can like
if if we remain calm and then they become agitated like especially the police officer like officer police like
you know or you know or or
just trying to ask a question like
you know i i i don't i don't desire anyone to become agitated
you know so
so if we can make him lose his cool that's great you know
we don't lose our cool
no we can't
we can't
this is seven
um this is gon+ na be seven as well
we need to be very careful about dan interrupting
i i mean i 've never seen dan in this type of scenario so i don't know
i don't know either
but i know in in purely conversational settings dan has no concept of of interruption
i don't know what to tell you
nope
he will just jump in
jump right in
have something to say have something to say
dan will have nothing to say from nine o'clock to twelve o'clock unless we ask him so
yeah we should definitely include him though
because like we
oh well he's part of it of course
because if we don't include him then then she's gon+ na start like taking it upon herself to include him
yeah

*zeledon13.csv*
so the goat escaped through a a bigger hole in my in my fence right
and mind you my grandfather used to walk that goat every morning around the neighborhood like like if it was like if it was a a dog
ah
so our next door neighbor had a dog right
and whenever the the neighbor would let the dog out
and he was like putting his work stuff away
and then so in when the dog
he closed the door
and he left for work
he didn't see the goat go in
so my grandfather wakes up like at ten
and he is looking for the goat frantic
and he's screaming around the neighborhood tete tete where are you
like that like frantic
so somehow some way he looks inside of the neighbor's house
uhuh
and there's the goat with the dog running around eating all the furniture pooping everywhere
that's crazy
we had to call our neighbors
we had to help them clean everything
we had to help them do all the furniture
it was just oh god
tete
tete where are you
ay
so do you have a funny story
you have super good stories
and i love how you tell them
oh yeah yeah
my family's just crazy
do anything crazy
oh my mom has a patch on her eye
why
i told you
she's got shit corneas
she used to have contacts
mind you the contacts are
uhuh oh i did that
i did that
the contacts are purely for show
hah
like for color
she had colored contacts on
i mean she doesn't have perfect vision
but they they have no prescription on it
uhuh
and so she she scratched her cornea really bad to the point that they had to do surgery
this was like ten years ago
so whatever she had like stitches and all that stuff
and apparently my mom's my mom my mom has really bad allergies
and she loves to like scratch her eye
you understand what i mean
uhuh
so she um she actually ended up scratching opening up stitches that she had from super long time ago that i guess never healed right
scratching it
oh that's crazy
so now you have to look at her
she looks like a pirate
she has a patch on one eye
you know what i mean
and like she's walking around
and she wants you to like feel bad for her
because she's like i don't feel good
but i was like tell her
um like yesterday
how how are your brothers
that's what i was about to tell you
almi's a almi's a snitch
yesterday he he wanted to use my computer
but like i get really moody
like when i get home and like i'm' tired
and like i just all i wan+ na do is be on my computer
like whether i'm' playing snood or on facebook or like googling random stuff
uhuh
so
snood
so he comes in
and he's like
they love to like use my computer
mind you we have another computer in the house
but my computer is the only one that's hooked up to a printer
so he's like oh i got+ ta print something out
he doesn't have to print out anything
he wants to go check sports net like
yeah
you know what i mean
like it's a fantasy football
and so whatever i locked the door so that he can't come in my room
because he loves to come in there
and then he he's like snitching on me
he's like mom she won't let me use the computer and i have to do something for school
so there comes my mom with her patch on her eye
feel bad for them oh oh pobrecito
they love your brothers
who my mom
yeah
no my mom kind of forgets they exist
they 're always at my grandma's house
yeah they don't live with us so
why
yeah
like they don't really like my house
so who lives at your house
you your mom and larry
no
me my mom larry which is my step dad larry's brother who came from cuba with his girlfriend who
his mistress who she's had for thirteen years
yeah
is this the story you told to miss smith
no this is a TRUE story
this isn't even
this is like new people
this is like new people that i didn't even know existed
this is one of like larry's
remember i told you larry has like five brothers
uhuh
this is one of his five brothers
with his mistress
with his mistress
he left his wife and his two kids in cuba
and they 're both living at my house
and then on top of everything larry's dad is living at my house
because he just got separated from his girlfriend
here in cuba like here here in miami who who when he came from cuba he started hanging out with this lady
then her son came from cuba
and then he's the one who's forming problems between larry's and the girlfriend
so larry's dad got fed up and moved out
but now he's not even home half the time
because he's still with her
but now they 're in a dating stage
ah
you know what i mean
they have they 're they 're in a dating
they 're getting to know each other
they 're getting to know each other
and then that's how it is
it's ridiculous
so your house is crazy
how many bedrooms do you have
oh my house is
i have three
which is my mom's that was split down the middle because it used to be two
mine
and then like the garage which is like a big room
but they like they remade everything
oh yeah no no no
my brothers don't sleep in the same room because they can't stand each other breathing
mmhm
they both breathe too loud
that's what they say
they breathe too loud
so we have one brother who sleeps in there
oh and they don't even have furniture
because we since we redid that entire room we were gon+ na redo furniture
like give them furniture
so then but then now they decided to put back up the wall in my mom's room so one of them can have that one
and the other one can have the other one
and the other one can have the other one
and then i have another room that larry has like his work stuff in there
and then
like whatever
so we didn't never get them finished thinking that we were gon+ na put up a wall
but we never put up the wall
so now oliver sleeps on a mattress in the in the garage
sleeps on a mattress in my mom's room with my mom and larry
ana and lexi sleep on another mattress in in like where the t_v room
and paco which is larry's dad sleeps on a

and she's like oh are you alive
i'm' like darla
like i'm' like no be like look i'm' sorry you know i had a lot of stuff to do but don't be like where are you you 're lost like if like if

i hate that
what is that
i hate that
i hate that
where are you
you 're lost
i'm' like great
um
i hate that
i know i know you don't like talking about it
but you know who i always talk to now
sara
crazy
like obviously she's like number one
like like super excited
more like super against each other
and she's coming this weekend
she um called me up
not called me up
she messaged me
she's like hey whatever i wan+ na come down i wan+ na see you
she wants to she wants me to go um to like amanda harding's house
mind you i don't even think amanda harding likes her
yeah i think she hates us
but no i think that she hates us by association
but i'm' sure sara's told her like oh no like whatever
yeah she's the one that was with
yeah
but you know who's really nice
ana
dud but i just saw
and her sister anita
i just got an email because i'm' i'm' like logged into this class
um you have to log into the herald
who sara
sara's mom
oh yeah
what is that
over robert she lost her job
she has three kids
she has four
but sara
she is
she is
yeah but she lost her duties
that's crazy
over robert
wait but didn't she get a new job
she supposedly
i guess when her and robert were like back together again
her mom um
i know she got a new job
her mom
she got reassigned somewhere
robert supposedly like choked her
oh yeah
so she pulled out a gun
what is she doing
robert hello
no it's not even
it's that robert lost his
it's that all these people are like insane
and i hate finding out about them
and i always like
i'm' like
you do you talk to her still
she called me once before she left
oh yeah
did you hear about the eye story
yeah
sara called me once before she left
i don't hate talking about it
um but
we 're just not friends
here's the thing
i at the end of the day i think she has a she has some of a heart
ok because she's done a lot of messed up things like the whole thing with brenda paltro
that she
yeah but how how is brenda even talking to her
yeah that's what i'm' saying
sara realized that she had messed up the next day
because she was belligerent
so she realized that she had messed up the next day
called her up
and said like sorry look
you know what i mean
i was messed up whatever i said things i didn't mean or whatever
and once you talk about it it's ok
like the whole thing with katrina
yeah but i don't like sara wanted to come to my house
did you hear what she said about katrina
did she
wait
did you hear what she said to katrina
no
ok katrina poked her on facebook
which was immature
that's not her business
why 'd she poke her
because she's stupid
just because you know to
to mess around
yeah to mess around
it's childish
whatever
and um sara wrote her back this nasty message
like destroyed her life
no yeah
this really
you know sara
ok when you mess with sara she goes after you your family anybody you 've ever been with
yeah but she's crazy
and like anybody
so you know what she told her
the kids you don't have
she told her
she's like flat out
she's like look
she's like i don't care to be your friend i don't know why you know what i mean you consider you know what i mean you try messing with me
and when i talked to her after she told me that a lot of it had to do with the reason why she was so angry is because when you guys were in a fight katrina got involved
did she ever get involved
i don't remember
something that katrina got involved with you with a like a situation between you guys
and then you know what she writes at the end of the message
she goes i hope that your father is looking down on you
sara
like because her dad's dead
and yeah
and then like whatever
like everybody was outraged that she had said such a thing
i didn't know katrina's dad died
when did he die
oh like a long time ago
when we were younger
but katrina's mom remarried no
no
i don't think so
i don't know katrina's life
oh my god i don't know it
and then um
i didn't know katrina's dad died
and then she talked about that
so all this stuff
and then everybody was like oh what is that she has no heart
all this stuff
and like when i talked to sara about it
because i talk to sara about everything flat out like the vacuum cleaner story in the apartment the turning on and off of the chime the comment about lesbians
ay but she's frikking crazy
like all that stuff i talk to her about
and she she was telling me that the whole thing with katrina is she felt bad after having said something
but she knew that if she hadn't said something so powerful katrina would+ a probably written back to that comment
and then it would+ a just started this whole thing
she's like i wanted to say something to her that she knew i meant business and that i want nothing to do with her
you understand what i mean
ok
look
i need to say something
so you know what that reminds me of
like the like elena thing
when they were like i don't think we should be friends i think we i think we should take a break
like how old are we
we 're super we 're super immature
ok like like that whole thing of like oh i needed to tell her her dead father
oh bro
what like what is that
yo bro
she's she's
but like she's like result of her like like family
she is
i think for real for real i think sara has like like issues
because dude i remember like when she was like living with me oh my god the nights that she would cheat on paul
and then call him crying
and this whole thing
she wanted to go see
oh you know how many times she's cheated on
but but ok
but how
like where in someone's right mind
but she
i don't know
but see like
but what is that dude
but what is that
like today she was texting
again
like does she like asking for forgiveness twenty six times like a month
and like i don't get
i don't get why you like feel like a like you 're caught
her leaving to tallahassee was like a big deal
it caused like a lot more problems than she
oh no here's the thing
when i found out ok
and where's she going after her t_c_c dude
ok to f_s_u
yeah right
she's getting in
when i found out that she had left to tallahassee without telling her mom anything and all this stuff
that's crazy
and it had just happened that thing with my mom
so when i went to tallahassee i look at her
and i'm' like sara you can't do that because at the end of the day that's your mom
and i guess like something clicked in her head
you know what i mean
that's the thing
that's the reason why me and sara
ana's always like i don't understand how you 're friends with her
all this stuff
the girl's shady she's done a whole bunch of shady things
yeah but the one person that i can talk to
like obviously i have veronica
and i have vanessa and stuff
but like ana and them they judge me all the time
you know what i mean
maybe not to my face
but they do
and vanessa i think to an extent judge me too
because we 're different
you know what i mean
mmhm
but me and veronica are very similar
you know what i mean
yeah hers is just her dad
and mine is my mom
so what happens is that sara's that type of person that i can go to sara
and i can tell her anything
you know what i mean
and i know she's not gon+ na judge me
why
because she's done pretty messed up things in her life
and she's had a pretty messed up family too
so it's not
you know what i mean
it's not like
she yeah she she's no one to judge me
yeah yeah yeah
and on top of everything when i tell her
i can i can talk to veronia as much as i can
and try to tell her things about my mom
but at the end of the day she has a mom who's great
you know what i mean
mmhm
who's there for her
and all that stuff
so
yeah
with veronica it's different
because at the end of the day i have the dad
and she doesn't have the dad
do you understand what i mean
but with sara it's um it's the it's the same issue
it's the moms
although her mom maybe more crazy than mine
you know what i mean
to a certain extent
because my mom's crazy
more crazy in a certain point
and her mom is more crazy
it's different yeah yeah
and another point
so that's why
you know what i mean
i talk to her
so when i talked to her about that whole thing i think it kinda clicked in her head
and her and her mom were good for a
you know what i mean
after the tallahassee her mom even took her up
they don't talk like her and her mom
and stayed there
i'm' not i'm' not sure how their relationship is right now
when i go see her i think i'm' gon+ na do it
yeah
oh after that whole thing with robert
and that he got arrested because of um violence with
remember that day we called her with the new wife
there was like a whole issue
yeah yeah i know
i got the email
yeah
it's crazy
there was a whole issue or whatever
and then i think i think that
from the harold
what do what do what do you mean you get
like
i'm' i'm' subscribed to the harold online
oh
i have to in my classes for my for my technology class
i know but
so it sends me the paper online
like instead of having the paper
oh so you read it
well there it's like headlines
i get all the articles
all separate
oh so your your your
it's all it's all it's like i get every section separate
because i only signed up for the ones i wanted
and then one of them had to do like business
and whatever
i don't even know which one they 're under
but yeah i got those
yeah so
it's just retarded
she called me when she left
but i don't think she was like ok
because well that day was like crazy
and i was at my house
and i had just gone on this retreat
and i was showing her the video of like my group whatever
and then she's like i didn't have
she got a new number
i didn't have it saved
then she's like
and i was like
oh my god
i'm' like yeah
she's like hey it's sara
i'm' like hey sara
it was weird
i hadn't said her name in like months
and then um she's like of course super defensive
she's like look if you can't talk to me it's fine
i'm' like
like hey
what's up
you know
then she's like look i just wanted to call
she's like i just wanted to call to apologize
and all this stuff
we had a great friendship but i don't think it should+ a ended the way it did
you remember everything she did right
yeah
ok
she's like i don't think it should+ a ended the way it did it's just you know like i was mad at you
and i was like
yeah you should+ a been the one mad at her
what
yeah
she's like but you know like i don't know like i don't know i have a lot of your stuff
oh that's another thing
she had a lot of my stuff
right
so she told janet that she was gon+ na throw them in the middle of the lourdes parking lot
which would+ a been like beyond
but janet was like no don't do that give me some of it
so janet didn't want
like she took my betsey johnson purse
and she never gave it back
wow
whatever
which it doesn't even matter
because that's something materialistic
but um
oh were you in my class the day she came to take a book from my class
she's like give me my book
oh i heard of that
i heard that
ok whatever
that day i went upstairs
and i shouldn't have done it
now that i think about it
i'm' like bro i like lowered like under her level

and i was like
well i even like regret that then
oh i remember that
now i should now that was like stupid of me
that was huge controversy
but so stupid
whatever
and then i told her like shut up
and the whole thing
and then that day that she called me she's like like i know you guys did a lot for me and you guys were really there for me like a bad time
and i was like ok sara
then she's like look
she's like i was thinking like maybe before i leave can we go to lunch

sara's like kinda like really loose in the head
sometimes it like upsets me like of how much like time like my family and stuff like spent
and i know you shouldn't regret that
you know
but it's just like oh it's like
yeah
bro all the fights i had my mom with my mom for real it was like ok
for what
you know what i mean
like it's like whoa i put my family through hell
the day of my birthday we were driving her to fort lauderdale
you know my mom paid for her s_a_t
like just things that i don't i don't regret doing
but i'm' like
yeah why 'd you do it
like why yeah
whatever
she was a good friend at one point in time
yeah for like a few months
and you felt bad for her
you know what i mean
you thought whatever
yeah but at the end bro it was like weak
crazy how like like all the things she was saying
i'm' like who you talking to
who are you talking to
is there anybody there
no
oh
at the end like everything she would do and all the things she would say
and like the malicia
and the stuff she would tell like
julie's like half my brain ok
like julie is like i talk to her every day twice a day whatever
i'm' like what do you
sara's like what are you doing
i'm' like what you forgot
like
all the times
i don't know
it's just weird
it felt like very like
it's like my it's like my sister says
like bipolar
i forgive
but i never forget
so you can forgive sara
but you never forget everything that happened
yeah yeah yeah
look look at this ring
it turned my finger blue
like it's it looks like my tattoo
yeah
but i like it so much
but she told that
when she called to apologize for hurting her
she was like oh i'm' just bitter because you chose melanie's friendship over mine
ok one mel and i are like
was like oh ok sara
wait
you know why we call
she's like that's why you 're
and um that's like drama central
you know you know why we call bonnie guite right
it's making fun of you guys
for real
yes because you guys talk like little muffin like
no it's bonnie
it's bonnie
and so then like we love to have you
from from flavor of love yeah
yeah so so whatever
we always thought it was super funny how you guys called her guite
but her name has nothing to do with guite
so then bonnie who really is guite we just started calling her guite
and then like it stuck
i mean at the beginning it was like to make fun
but now just like i like it
like i like her
whenever she calls me i'm' like
aaron
i used to hate guite
guite
no no no you smell like
you smell like that pot i put in my oven
i'm' disgusting
i can't wait to shower
ay used to live in the corner
like senior skit the other day
we were watching senior skit
ay
what
it's a very cuban thing
do you put pots in the oven
yeah
oh that's the worst
the second you go to bake cookies you have to like unload
yeah
everything
it's like twenty
and you 're like
susana
susana
we don't do crazy stuff like that
but sara's here for like good
no no no no no
ok sara had told me that she didn't know if she was gon+ na stay in tallahassee because her parents her grandparents were paying for it
but they couldn't pay for it
because sara doesn't have bright future
she doesn't have
she yeah first robert was paying for it
when robert started paying for it he wasn't even paying for his kids
that was crazy
i think robert did it out of spite
for everything
i think robert did it out of spite
and then
bro carry takes that to court robert's broke
she had to
she had told me that um that her grandparents weren't gon+ na pay for it anymore
yeah but what here dude
and she was gon+ na have to figure out what to do
but from what i heard she's already planning to move in with all these people or whatever
yeah yeah
but
why would she be planning a move if
you know what i mean
but who's paying for the rent
i don't know
maybe maybe finally she
maybe she's not paying for it
maybe she's
maybe she doesn't have to pay for the rent
maybe she doesn't have to pay
or maybe maybe she's she's maybe her like cathy
cathy like breeds out of her butt
maybe what she told cathy was oh i'll' move in into your room
you know what i mean
and like we'll' just share a room but you pay for the rent or whatever
yeah either way she always stays with derek
yeah but who's paying for t_c_c
i she she had originally said she was taking out loan
but i don't believe she ever took out loan
oh my god
do you know what i mean
first of all if if if you 're taking out loans in your undergraduate
if you 're taking out loans in your undergraduate there's a problem
you know what i mean
because that that's
yeah but what what is she gon+ na be
if you 're if you 're gon+ na be a doctor i 'd be like whatever bro
oh
no
take them all out
now she says
you 're paying them all back
now she says she wants to be in now she says she wants to be a cop
because we were talking when me and her we started talking about the whole and the whole controversy and the rooms and all that stuff
do do do her friends like
do her friends what
no no
no that's just
that's like the biggest thing i heard
here's the thing
when that when that was issued when that was given to them like that nickname by lucy was given to them then they took it to a whole another level
here's the thing
if you get called something and you know it's not TRUE and you think it's so funny that that person even thought about it
you drop it
uh you know hello
i don't drop it
remember what she called me
that was crazy
i don't drop it
oh i don't know about that
there's like there's i don't think i don't think that story's like that wrong
according to her no
i don't think that maybe she did it
but i think i think there's something behind that
i don't know
dude you can't get that out of nowhere
i don't know
i mean whether lucy said it
lucy said it because
i mean there was something there
like that they kissed or whatever whatever
yeah but their pictures are gross
have you seen the pictures
that's what i'm' telling you
the pictures now attribute to the fact that lucy said what she said
they 're just taking the joke to a whole another level
that's what happened with the whole dyke thing
mmhm i dunno
and
but i would almost drop it
that's what i kept telling sara
i'm' like just drop it already
she's like
oh she's
yeah that's what i kept telling her
but whatever
oh well the whole cop thing
she was telling me that
and you know that sara's very
she was telling me that she feels like breaking face in
you know what i mean
but the reason why she doesn't do it is because she already has a a a violence on her record
that's one
oh my god
and two
who is she
yeah that she already has violence on her record
and two she doesn't want that you know what i mean anymore because the violence from before was from what we were sophomores
so that's like expunged the minute you you turn eighteen
you know what i mean
it's expunged
yeah it's expunged
so whatever
you know what i mean
and like now she says that she wants to go in to in to like the police force and whatever
and she wants to do it
to police force
i think i think you have to you have to
and don't you have to start off like an explorer or something crazy like that
you have to you have to major in like i think maybe that maybe maybe like you should major in like law studies
or something like that
or like criminal justice
yeah but isn't t_c_c only two years
and then later on you become
t_c_c is two years
it's a community college
i mean you could be in a community college for four years
but it's your first sixty credits
you don't need college
yeah but where where is she going
yeah
but where is she going
she goes right now to t_c_c if she even goes to school
i don't really know sara's academic career
yeah but i'm' saying where is she going after
she's not does she have grades f_s_u
i don't know
i don't know
i don't know
i'm' gon+ na i'll' talk to her about it
see what she wants to do or whatever
well she could+ a done so good here
the coach was like sara
oh she could+ a been an an excellent runner
they would+ a paid for everything
they could+ a had a full
you don't get it
right
but
she just said it
all she needed was ten more points
ten more points on her s_a_ts
you know what that is
it's like dot your i on your name
give me a break
it's like cross your fingers
you'll' get it
you know
ten points dude
ten points
yeah but that but usually like they help you
if like your scores are low they still help you get in
but hers weren't like like she needed to improve them
like there wasn't anything the coach could do whatever
but he told her
he's like improve them i can give you dorm i can give you
you know because if if she filed
i told her
you know how many times i told her about
and at this time her grandparents had custody of her
which means she would+ a had to have put her grandparents's information
they 're two retired people
ok
that get paid off of like medicare or whatever
you know what i mean
social security
that's crazy
so you know how much money she would+ a gotten
her grandparents must make like what twenty thousand
bro she threw that all away
but you know what
she threw everything away
when we stopped being friends that's when she left to t_c_c
but i i told her
for real
when we stopped being friends she was coming with me
i took her to all the all the coaches that that like every time the coach wanted to eat with her she didn't want him to know that she didn't have a car
would take her
you know
whatever
i took her to seriously like ten dinners
maybe like four
i took her to whatever
the coach was like super on her
he called her every day
all this stuff
the second we stopped being friends she was like
oh she thought everything was like this
cathy got into f_s_u because of me
ok
but doesn't cathy go there for free
because
yeah
listen
she got she got in for free because of me
because you told her right about the thing
the care program
ok
because we were sitting in art class
cathy cathy had no thought of even gon+ na tallahassee
ok
and and i was talking to my who was great ok
who she knew since the minute my sister left that school that that's where i wanted to go
mmhm
you know what i mean
miss thomas who was great
she would call esther every day
you know what i mean
and then she told me look there's a loophole your grades aren't that well
which mind you i brought up my grades senior year like ridiculous
i graduated with a three point eight from lourdes
you know what i mean
why
because i was just lazy
if i put my mind to it i can do it
mmhm
because i'm' not stupid
i just i'm' lazy
and so what happened was that she she had told me about the care system whatever and all this stuff
and it was if your parents made under a certain amount of money
um mine's happened because my mom was divorced
whatever it was all the money issue
and you know how like cathy isn't that well off
mmhm
and like her parents have they have a business but like
they have like flimsy jobs yeah yeah
but like yeah
but like it's like going down
and whatever all this stuff
like lucy was always talking to us about how her parents were helping out with cathy and all that stuff
yeah yeah yeah
and i told her about it
and she's like oh ok i'm' gon+ na go ask my counselor
because her counselor didn't care
you know what i mean
like if if she didn't get in
yeah
she and then so she went to her counselor
she got that thing
she wrote the great essay
all this stuff
she got in
yeah but cathy and lucy haven't been friends for a long time
the thing is is that if when you have a friendship so for such a long time lucy was always the dominant one
and cathy was always the one that just followed along whatever lucy said
and so what happened was that that lucy would kind of like not mistreat cathy but she would kinda like take cathy for granted
you know what i mean
and like tell her things
and then and what happened was then cathy became close to esther who is more or less like her
because esther is a very is a very is a person who follows
she she you know what i mean
you tell her what to do and she does it
so they became friends
and then when lucy saw that esther and cathy were getting close together she
well lucy had her phases
oh she had her phase
i remember
lucy had the craziest moments
oh yeah
i remember
do you remember when it was like
i remember when there was like a point that it was like people are like scared of lucy
like no one wanted to talk to her
she was that scary
when we went on retreat
because she was that
when we went on retreat
first of all she treated mark like crap
ok because i remember distinctly a game a game
is she better now
yeah
a game here
i'll' tell you right now story
mmhm
i remember a story distinctly a game here at at um f_i_u columbus versus something that she was screaming at mark like if mark was her kid
screaming at him
telling him all these things like
people thought she was crazy
like all the all
lucy i mean esther bonnie and tiffany were ready to drop that friendship
ok
so the point
oh
then we went then we went on encounter
oh she was insane
ok
on encounter went i went on encounter junior year in hopes of becoming a
and senior year i could be um like i could be one of the talks

*zeledon2.csv*
so where do you work
i work well i'm' currently employed by
i have my broker
he's a real estate broker
my attorney he's a real estate attorney
mmhm
i work for a title company
i work because um
my attorney consolidated with the broker
he owns both businesses
but like his business partner he's the broker
and his business has been so bad they consolidated
so now i work for both of them together simultaneously
oh i see
mmhm oh ok
they just pay me you know four hours one pays me the other one pays me four hours a day like that
but i
and what do you do like receptionist or
i'm' like the office bitch
people can say
pardon my french
no it's all right
but um i do everything
i answer phones
i get the mail
i order supplies
i babysit the realtors because they don't half of them don't know what they 're doing
they don't know any of the forms
they don't know anything
mmhm
so i'm' a administrative assistant
i'm' a receptionist
ok
i'm' a post closer
ok
wow
i am the head of the post closing department
i deal with everything that has to do
once a deal closes like when you buy a house
mmhm
you would go to a title company to do your closing
right
to sign all the paperwork
after that i do the package
i send it to the bank
i deal with you know funding conditions
then i'm' the one who prepares the policy
i do recordings
you know i send the stuff to be recorded to the court
you do a lot
yes
i do a lot and
and where is that at
it's in doral
oh ok
but um
you live here in miami right
yeah
where
do you know where the mall of the americas is
yeah
and the walmart
well not specifically the walmart but i know where the mall of the americas is
it's by there
right by the palmetto
yes
ok
you know where chevys is
no
no
i 've only lived here for like a year well a year as of december
right where are you from
new jersey
right
ok
and do you live
i live in miami yeah
but where
um
you have to tell me a place because
yeah
um
you know how women are in directions
you have to give them a landmark
yeah
how about
well it's off of bird road
i know i'm' sure you know where bird road is right
yes
right
can we use bird bowl
bird what mall
bird bowl
bird bowl um yeah yeah
you 've been to bird bowl
no i have seen it but never been there
uh
um bird bowl farther west
er
way farther west like bird bowl is around like ninetieth avenue
ninety second
yeah i i'm' around one fifty second
yeah

ok
i don't
lakes of the meadow you never heard of it

job description
what i told you is pretty much you know the receptionist the administrative assistant stuff is mostly for ok both companies do that
post-closers for the title company
i also process files like when they come in a new file you know request title
right
mmhm
ok then for the the broker um the realtors don't have to input their own listings i input them for them
oh i see
so if a house is going up for sale you know they bring me the listing i input it into this m_l_s it's the system or whatever
yeah yeah i know what you 're doing now
and um
most of them don't know what they 're doing
they don't know the forms
it's it's really bad
because i
if you see i have so much to do that when they come to me and they tell me you know how to do their job it annoys me
because i don't have time to babysit them
what happened
your cuban comes out
yeah
and then um like if i have if i have to go to the bank to do deposits
yeah actually um like last week i had interviewed um back in november i had interviewed with an insurance company and this lady she emailed me she emailed me out of nowhere last week and told me oh you know are you happy where you are because you know the girl that we hired back in november she has been promoted are you you know interested in and i was like
mmhm
i wrote back to her i was like well i'm' not really happy where i am and um um she goes
oh no and she writes back to me and she is like oh we 're interested you know eleven dollars an hour
i'm' like oh really you know
mmhm
and then um maybe you make more than i do but whatever
no
is that that's yeah that that's not it doesn't matter
i told my attorneys and the broker
i sat them down and i'm' like look this is what's going on
and they are like oh you know thank you for letting me know
mmhm
yeah
but um then they told me oh no you know we'll' raise you starting next week you'll' start at ten and then in two months we'll' start you at eleven
so it's good because i don't wan+ na leave where i am
i mean i 've been there for two years
that's not bad
i know my job like the back of my hand
and then if i leave to the insurance company i 'd be learning everything from scratch
you 'd have to start over yeah i know and you should stay
i don't know the people so i don't know if their
no you should stay
the lady seems a little anal
yeah
so
what's your major by the way
my major
mmhm
undecided
why are you undecided
declared undecided but
ok
i wan+ na become an optometrist
oh really
yeah
maybe even an ophthalmologist if i go the nerve to go to med school
you can help me out because i have bad eyes
i have contacts
me too
really
what's your prescription
i think damn you know i don't
mmhm
oh wait oh no no no yeah negative three point two five in one negative three point five in the other
you think you 're bad hmm
i have a negative six
is it
oh my god really
point seventy five
and then negative five point
no it's negative six point five and negative five seventy five
so if you think you 're blind you should have my eyes for a few days
so when you take your contacts out you can't see
i can't see crap
really
yeah i can't see anything
i thought i was the only one on that boat
no because when i
i
well you know what i hate the most is um
and i should get glasses
i had glasses
i i lose i i lose things so
but um like when i when i'm' watching t_v and it's getting late i just wan+ na fall asleep watching t_v
so you don't wear
but i have yeah i have to take them out you know
yeah
so that that's what sucks you know
yeah
and i'm' looking at
well what sucks for me
squinting you know
is that no when i get home i take off my not really before i go to bed i take off my contacts and obviously i have my glasses
but i put them on and then if i take them off and i put them down somewhere forget it i lost them
mmhm
i can't see them
so i have to like feel around for them so
oh ok
so you can't see up close either
no i can't see far
ok
i mean you 'd have to be like right here for me to see you
really
i have twenty twenty from like close like if i didn't have them on i could see i can read fine you know
oh no i can't
like i if you know i can read that
oh no
but you know if like if you were to say what does that say i would
i like if i was
no if i had to read this like i had to be like like this close to be able to see it yeah it's really bad
oh really
oh ok
oh right
and i'm' scared to do lasik
yeah i was thinking about that
what
they well they recommend you to wait till you 're twenty five
oh really
because it's when your vision kinda just balances out
oh
i didn't know that
because at first they told me it was twenty one
but i'm' twenty one and my vision keeps you know increasing and getting worse
yeah it it keeps getting worse yeah
and um i 'd say decreasing and then um my doctor he's like oh wait till you 're twenty five
and i'm' scared because like if they do it and it doesn't come out right you can't go back to contacts
yeah
you have to do glasses
so
why can't you go to contacts because
i don't know
i guess it's something with
it's something yeah something they do that
because they cut you know they they like cut the the retina the like retina off
if they laser it
yeah but there's two different kinds of lasik
is there
yeah there's lasik and then there is another procedure
i saw it on this show it's called ten years younger
mmhm mmhm
on t_l_c i think it's
yeah yeah
and um
do you like t_l_c
the yes
that's good i like t_l_c too
and the discovery channel and all that
yeah
the history channel more
i'm' a i'm' a t_v buff
yeah
i have a lot of favorite shows
yeah like what
like ok definitely law and order s_v_u
which show
all the i like all the law and orders
c_s_a c_s_i
c_s_i
i
i love new york and vegas
when i got here
i don't like miami
no
when i got here that's what i started watching c_s_i miami
c_s_i miami
and i was like wow this is a good show but after
have you ever seen vegas
yeah i 've seen vegas
i don't know everybody tends to like that one better
because it's the original one
yeah
mmhm
but after like six months i was like i can't take it
it's too far-fetched
it's too you know first of all a precinct doesn't look like that
oh but i love it
the employees don't look like that
obviously
well come on
it's cable
i know
well not even cable because at all
it's t_v
it's t_v
i know but i like law and order because it's a lot it's it's it's real you know
yeah
i love it like
it seems real
i love without a trace
actually actually i haven't seen that
cold case
have you seen that
cold case is good
i love it
i love house
house is really good
i love house
yeah
what's another one
what er um
i like the on a_and_e it's called the justice files or whatever cold case files but real ones
mmhm
you know that i love
you know what
i love that
the the problem with that is that when i watch like c_s_i and law and order i know it's not real
so once you put me like
in a real situation
if watching the real things it affects me
yeah
oh i see
yeah
so i don't i don't know why
wow no um there's there's nothing wrong with that wow that's
so i don't
because when i was senior year
mmhm
junior and senior year i got into psychology
and i specially the abnormal psych
yeah
and i started reading a lot on um like psychopaths and you know stuff
right right right
i was also
i took psychology too
and i was really interested in that stuff too
did you take a_p
no i didn't get into that
i took a_p psych
because i
it was crazy
yeah
the national was crazy
i got a four which is good
wow you really
wow
i thought i was gon+ na fail it but i got a four
it's good so why don't you do that
i can't i'll' go crazy
you watch c_s_i
i'll' go crazy along with them
no
i can't do it it's too much
really
i'm' not that strong psychologically
you are too much of a moral person
no
it impacts you
yeah it does
you take it personally
i do i i can't
even with t_v sometimes like if i'm' watching s_v_u or anything right before i go to bed
oh yeah well that's the point that's what makes it a good show you know if if you kind of take it personal
yeah
but imagine just having their jobs
you know
oh yeah yeah
i i couldn't be able to do it
i couldn't be able to handle it
no of course
i'll' break down like i i'm' gon+ na need like a psychiatrist
you'll' need therapy after yeah
like you know all all the like the psychologists go into the psychiatrists
you'll' need therapy after the case
no i wouldn't yes
i wouldn't be able to
i think people
i don't know either you have experienced something that and that's why you 're fighting against it
right
or you 're just born you know with that strength to deal with all that you know because it's hard
yeah
i wouldn't be able to do it
yeah well um it's like an outlook it's your perspective you know what i'm' saying i i take things personally
but
mmhm
you got+ ta you know on the other you got+ ta say like well sometimes you know i think you have to understand both sides first before you take it personally
i think
would you take it personally
but the thing is is is not even taking it personally is you know don't bring your work home
it's just no i know
right
mmhm
but i wouldn't be able to do that
i don't think anybody that does that can go by that
right
i don't think anybody's able
we 're all we 're humans
you know what i'm' saying
exactly
mmhm
no i don't think anybody can just say no
i shut it off at night
you know it's not something that
you can't it's easier said than done
exactly
obviously
and we can't do it
yeah
it's like you 're trying to sleep and your brain doesn't wan+ na shut up
exactly
mmhm
that brain chatter is what it's called

you don't see it
oh ok
no yeah yeah i do
i'm' just saying like other people i don't see that much
like i i see how it's funny
but i'm' like it it ain't that funny you know what i'm' saying
but like for me comedy like really really good comedy is obviously um comedy central
i like the colbert report
i don't watch comedy central
i never used to watch it but i when i saw the colbert report and the um and um damn um jon stewart
john stewart is funny
oh my god
well actually i'm' just saying it
the daily show
jon stewart at the oscars he was hilarious
yeah
give it a try
what it is all all that show is like the daily show and the colbert report is is like
like talk shows
watching the no no no it's not a talk show
it's not a talk show
it's like watching the news
what they do is they take news from the whole from the day
ok
like from c_n_n and something like that like the elections whatever
and they they make fun of it
ok
everything's funny
ok
you know what i'm' saying
they they show pictures and they'll' say this
it's like the soup have you ever seen the soup
the soup
on e
with joel
oh yeah yeah yeah
somewhat somewhat yeah
just not as
but it this is like exaggerating
i mean they exaggerate stuff they say whatever they want
now you should you should watch it
well obviously it's cable
yeah give
because it's comedy central
right but give it a try
you'll' like it
but what show what comedy show do you like that is not on
that's not on comedy central
yeah
um
like just a regular
that's like oh i used to love everybody loves raymond
you know i like him but i can't
it has to be certain days that i could just sit through a whole show of everybody loves raymond
really
yeah
oh that's that's cool
it's a certain
like in a show
yeah it's a certain kind of comedy
it's like an acquired taste
me like i don't i like comedy like that that it's innocent and it's just everyday
yeah right
but like raunchy comedy like people that use like i don't know sex or insults and stuff like that i don't think that's funny
ok
no
no because i
well yeah no it's and it's not it's just not right
it's what you see
have you ever been to the renaissance festival
no
ok well this is the renaissance yeah
is that here
really
it's in um where is it
it's further i don't even know because i don't know directions
but um quiet waters park
it's is it penbroke pines
oh ok ok
i don't know it's one of those that you have to drive a little yeah
one of those little cities near
so it's a renaissance festival
ok
and then they have this show
the guy's called christoph the insultor
and basically you pay him to insult you
mmhm
really
it's ridiculous the guy walks out with like five hundred dollars worth of people you know
yeah yeah
like people would pay for or it's a group that they pick one person
yeah
they put money together and then depending on you know how much they give him he'll' how long he'll' insult the person for
right right right
but it's so stupid like i didn't find comedy in it
no
i like like friends
have you ever seen that
friends is good yeah of course yeah
you know friends is funny
yeah
and what else is funny
mmhm
dane cook
i like the
no dane cook is really funny but he is vulgar come on
well but
he is vulgar oh are you saying you don't like vulgarity
well i haven't really seen his stand-ups
i 've seen his movies like
yeah
you know um good luck chuck
well that that was pretty raunchy ok but
that's pretty the specially the unrated
that's what i saw
ok but
i think that
i was like what
that's like a porno
it is yeah it's bad
but did you see um
i have it i bought it too what a damn ass
you know the part that i busted out laughing
the part when she goes like this
and then he's like what happened to you did you get in a fight with a stamp
oh oh yeah yeah yeah
you know that part is
oh yeah she was
i think that part was so funny
yeah
it was all unexpected to me and i cracked up i was
really
i hadn't laughed like that in a while
i just saw it the other day
but i like comedy like that
there you go
i like the family guy
family guy
a lot
you know i don't
a lot like a lot
i if i watch it alone i don't find the humor in it
yeah
no
i don't
wow
maybe it's just
but if i'm' with other people i see i don't know
it the thing about it it's it's really subtle it's it's well it's not even subtle i mean it's like in your face
right
you know what i'm' saying
i guess maybe it's so in my face that
it's yeah it's not even that
i don't get it
it's like what peter says it's all like it's all it's either racial
right
mmhm
against against against against gender or where you 're from
political i mean everything
ignorant
everything it's it's everything
that's why i like it because it's like blatant
right
you know what i mean
mmhm
they don't care you know
whatever it's stereotypes
like me i watch it and i don't laugh
like maybe i'll' smile whatever but i won't laugh
like i have friends i have a group of friends that are addicted to family guy
yeah yeah
yeah
and then when they talk about it and they say things that they say in the show
i laugh
yeah
because they make it funny and because i don't see the humor
i see the humor in what they are doing
specially stewie the baby
i love stewie
he's because he has like a an accent because he's so smart
yeah
you know what i'm' saying
he is always trying to kill his mother i mean
it's
or or another thing they do
or this one time peter you know the peter peter right the fat guy
he he he tripped right
yeah i know who they are
and he he like banged his knee
mmhm
and then he he he he he like sat on the floor and was holding his knee he was like
and he did that for i think a minute
it was just that for like a minute him doing that noise
mmhm
that's it like it's just it's
stupid
right
but it's the noise it's like all right go on you know
ok
yeah that now but that family is i think it's great
well
actually you know what i used to do
mmhm
i had a d_v_d player in my car like an in-dash when i lived in hawaii and
you lived in hawaii
yeah
wow
yeah
for how long
for a year
was it beautiful
oh yeah
i'll' tell you about that though but
every morning when i 'd go to base when i 'd go to port harbour i would play it like every morning
is that illegal
yeah you are not supposed to do that but
that's how much i liked it
you know what i'm' saying
and i would play it every
that was my like breakfast yeah family guy
family guy
you know
i guess i don't watch a lot of comedy because
it doesn't
i don't know you can't gain knowledge from it
i understand
and you feel like you 're wasting your time
not really because i love comedy
i love laughing
yeah
but
if i'm' gon+ na put time
you want something informative
yeah i wan+ na learn something
and i
something that's gon+ na stimulate your brain
yeah
no i know
because in comedy you really don't have to figure out anything
you know
yeah yeah
like in a murder
well
like
well actually with like with the family guy you got+ ta be quick
because if you don't you know
if you are not
i'm' not quick
if you are not quick
and you are not informed like on different cultures
you won't get it
right
right
you you understand
i think that's my problem
you know like like this one time they had a plane
and it had a banner on it
it said it said one thing
and then it the banner flew off
and it said colombian drugs
you know what i mean
it it's it's like that
ok
if you don't know then you are not gon+ na laugh
ok
like that you know
they they make fun of everybody
right
everything
like this one time peter is um was like i need to be rich
and he then he then he started singing a song like i need a jew
what
do you know what i mean
mmhm
because jewish people are rich so he's like i need a jew you know
that's what i'm' talking about
you see i wouldn't get it
because
it's cultural that's what i'm' saying
and it's like it's like what
you know
yeah
you know yeah
i wouldn't i wouldn't catch onto it
yeah
i guess that's why i don't find it funny
yeah
i have to have someone next to me explaining these things so
yeah no but you know it's funny
but hawaii hawaii is beautiful
very beautiful
my uncle was there during i think it was the second world war
no i lied
i don't know
he was i know he was in the military
and he was stationed in hawaii
oh ok yeah
have you been anywhere besides miami
uh um i 've only been on cruises
oh ok so you 've been to what the bahamas
i 've been to cozumel
yeah
yeah mmhm
in mexico
i 've been to grand cayman island
and ocho rios jamaica
how was that
well the city itself
how old were you
fifteen
ah ok
the city itself is not pretty
like it's nothing to look at
right
right
i guess
i mean the beaches are beautiful
mmhm
but um we climbed the the dunns river falls
it's like i don't know how many feet
it's the
and then you climb to the first two hundred feet of the falls
and you have they yeah they have guides
right
that who will guide you
what the
and you need you know the water socks to go up
because the rocks are slippery you know
on the water
yeah
the water's freezing
yeah
it's the coldest water i 've ever you know
in jamaica
it's just the waterfalls
oh the waterfalls oh yeah yeah that's fresh water yeah
it's freezing it's freezing
it doesn't matter how hot it is outside the water it would always be freezing
mmhm
and um there was this couple that they didn't go with the guides
they decided to go up the middle
retards
and they fell
they slipped
and they fell down i don't know how many feet
and they had they on a rock
and they had broken ribs
everything they were full of blood
and it was crazy
wow
well at least you saw something right
huh
at least you saw something
yeah at least
but it's it was pretty
and then that part was pretty
but the city is
no
like and then guys offering you weed
yeah and then you see like them wrapping the weed on the plants
yeah
i don't know i don't know
you don't smoke
huh
you don't smoke
no
that's good
i find it gross
it's good
you shouldn't
do you
no
i don't what else what else what else
and then in the second one we went to saint thomas the virgin islands
we went to the bahamas
to atlantis atlantis
atlantis
yeah
yeah beautiful
it's beautiful
yeah
and where is the other one
and dominican republic
oh ok
and then in in the united states well i 've been to orlando

busch gardens and islands well islands is universal too
yeah
yeah
i 've been to cooperstown new york
oh yeah
i 've been to the baseball hall of fame
wow
that's where it is
i 've been to
we went to north carolina on a road trip
we stopped one night in atlanta
so that doesn't really count
because we we never we didn't stay there
yeah
where else have i been to
well spring break i'm' gon+ na virginia beach
oh yeah v_a beach
huh
v_a beach
v_a beach
yeah
that's what we call it
i'm' from i'm' from up north so
it's v_a beach yeah
that's what they call it
v_a beach
and nobody calls it virginia
everybody says v_a beach
ok v_a beach
that's where i'm' going
spring break
yeah
because
no that's cool
you'll' have fun
my cousins live there
don't don't expect the beaches to be like this though
oh no no no no no i'm' not gon+ na the beach
it's cold water
it's gon+ na be cold over there
no it's my cousin's fifteens
and she lives up there
don't get too wild
no i won't
are you a wild person
no
you are not a party person
no
i am actually going this saturday for the like the first time to a club
really you are not a club person either
no
wow all right that's that's fine
there's nothing wrong with that
um i guess there is more to life than clubs
so what do you do on the weekends then yeah no and there is
well um well i was when i turned
i like everything
yeah
it just depends on the song
ok
if i like it doesn't matter the genre if it's country if it's pop rock anything
as long as i like the song
yeah yeah yeah
like the thing was when i was when i turned fifteen i met this guy
mmhm
we were together for four years
wow
and he was very machista
yeah yeah yeah
oh
and he isolated me from everybody from my friends
and i mean it was my fault in the way that i allowed him to do that
but um
i got you
it happened
yeah
and then we broke up
well i broke up with him
thank god that was over
and the friends that you had when you were fifteen you know people change
in four years specially those years from fifteen to nineteen you change a lot
oh yeah definitely
and i i tried you know to go back to those old friendships
but it wasn't the same
oh i see
obviously you can't expect to find the same thing you left four years before
no no no
and obviously there's grudges from people you know
you leave
and

*zeledon3.csv*
that's good
no it isn't
no i'm' not
yeah you are
i just have a habit of not putting things where they go
mmhm
well i have to train them
so
you have to train them
yeah
so
and we have to see if they get good at it
they 're actually trying to like succeed in the job
so yeah
well there should be a lot of people that wan+ na work in togo
huh
well there should be a lot of people that need work
well i don't know
they haven't hired anybody yet
so i'm' just waiting
how old do you have to be to work there
can't alberto work there
he's sixteen
no you have to be eighteen to work in chili's
that sucks
yeah
no it doesn't
because if you do it with kids you have to work around their school hours
yeah but like over the summer like a summer job
and
maybe
well yeah maybe we get people in the summer
but for now we don't have anybody
and they don't hire under sixteen
and if they were to hire
under what eighteen or sixteen
uh under eighteen
but if they hired someone like sixteen they can only work certain amount of hours
and they can't work before six
they can't work after eleven
so i don't know if they 're gon+ na hire younger kids in the summer
but i think they 're not supposed to
i think the law says that we 're not supposed to
then how come publix hires
well because
you only have to be fourteen to work at publix
i know but the only job they give you is to bag groceries which is not hard
so i think
yeah you have to know where to put the eggs and then the all the bread and that kind of stuff
yeah but that's not hard
i think it must be hard
no it's not
which is
a meeting where trainers go
and we talk about progress
and
that must suck
no it doesn't
the first time we went to we went to like dave and busters i think
and then the second time we went to maggianos
lucky
what happened to discussing progress
we did
and then they gave us food
and now we 're gon+ na dave and busters again
lucky
yeah on thursday
but how many people are trainers
a lot
like twenty
there's
there's like in togo there's only two
but i think that i'm' the only one that's going
and servers there's like ten servers
ten about ten servers that are trainers
and what do trainers do
train
show other people how the job works
then why 'd you put you as a trainer
very funny
yeah i know you 're good at that
but uh what i'm' saying is that why 'd they pick you out of everyone that there is
because they see that i'm' the one that has that knows how to do it
that knows the job better than others
that can explain it to others
ok
uh that's the thing that gets you the discount that trainer card thing on the back that says discount
yeah
oh cool
so that's an advantage
it's good to be a trainer
because you help you 're helping your workplace by showing new people
get it
that's the whole point
yeah
so yeah i have a meeting that day
ok
on monday i have a midterm of art appreciation that class
they give you midterms
oh i had a midterm
i did i had i i have a midterm i had midterms
i did good
i have i only have for that class
i don't have a midterm for english
you have finals
yeah i have finals
i have to take an exit exam in in english class
like in order to pass it i have to pass the class and i have to pass that that exam to go on to english um eleven o one yeah
eleven o isn't it one o one
no
eleven o ok
yeah so that
and uh in math not doing to well yeah
got third
i'm' taking seventh grade math
actually ninth
it's not seventh grade
it's ninth grade actually
but i'm' gon+ na take it next year
look i'm' two years advanced
well i'm' not doing bad
it's just i struggle with some parts of the math
but it's not really hard
which are
multiplication addition subtraction
no
that's the easy part
division
it's like the problems
you know like the ones where it says if this this object has a height of this and it has a uh width of this so what is the area or something like that
that's not that hard
well it confuses me
so i had kinda struggled on the problem ones
oh yeah that always happens to me
i i just can't put uh i don't i'm' good at math i'm' good with the math
i just can't do the english part of the math
english part of the math
well like the reading and the english and that stuff
ok
yeah so uh i think i have like a b or a c in that class right now
but hopefully i can get my grades up
that's what i have in math
i have either a b_minus or a c_plus
yeah because apparently everybody says that in architecture there's a lot of math
yeah
you have to like measure the lines and all that stuff
yeah so i don't think i'll' have problems
that's just people over exaggerate
i think
we'll' see
i don't think i have that much math
but i don't know
it depends when i transfer
we'll' see
do you know when you 're planning to transfer
no huh
probably hopefully next year
five years
next year
if i
well i don't think so
but like maybe end of next year i'll' finish in b_c_c
and then i'll' start the winter in f_i_u if possible
but we'll' see
ok
yeah
do i have to answer that
uh yeah
i 'd rather not
ok you don't have to
you don't have to tell me if you like anybody
you just have to tell me que como te va
funny
mm
oh
yeah so is there any movie you wan+ na see that's coming up
um mm
no
thinking thinking thinking
meet the spartans
but you don't wan+ na see that
no
that movies looks hilarious
well i do too
it wasn't in theatres when i went the other day
really
i didn't see it
no they probably already took it out
yeah
i wan+ na see one that's called stop-loss
which is about what
it's a movie about these um guys that are in the that are in the army
and so they were in iraq for i dunno i guess couple years or months or something
and then they come back to texas
because that's where they 're from i guess
and so they 're ready to get out of the army
and because they did their duty and everything
and then the army says that they 're going back
because they don't
oh yeah i 've heard about that one
yeah they don't have enough people to fight the war over there
so they 're sending them back
so that's what i think stop loss means
that's dumb
and so like it's a battle deciding if they 're gon+ na do it or not
and it looks pretty cool
plus it has cute guys in it
yes
so yeah
since i love gon+ na movies with cute guys
that's a plus
so we'll' see if hmm yeah
we'll' see if i go see that movie
if we go see that movie because it looks cool
yeah when i get ungrounded in two months
ok maybe not with you
but maybe i'll' go see it or something
nothing new here
i applied for a credit card
what
i applied for a credit card
don't you already have like
no credit cards
what's the difference
debit card is like they pay it out of your they take the money out of your bank account
yeah
and credit is that ah you have to pay for everything
you get a bill of the things you paid with your credit card
and then you have to pay them off
so
why isn't debit better
you don't have to worry about bills
well
you just have to worry about losing all your money
well it really depends
like i think it depends on what you 're paying
because if it's a large sum and they take it out of your bank account and then you have other stuff to pay then you 're gon+ na be short in money
so if you do credit card they give you a certain time for you to pay them off
so you don't have to you know pay them on the spot
oh
so yeah
what about him
yeah sometimes
but he doesn't hang out with you guys
yeah sometimes
but he gets annoying
so you guys aren't friends anymore
yeah but he's always like
he always gets annoying
and like i don't know
what about david
yeah he's fine
yeah well friends with sam
who's gon+ na be who's gon+ na be your best friend when sam leaves
i don't know
well i don't know because um adrian gets annoying
now he barely have any has any friends
like well we 're sort we 're still sorta his friends
but he gets like all annoying so not really
and aside from us he has like no friends at all
um
oh david david's yeah david's my friend
and i have another friend named adam
he no he's mostly david's friend
but
sometimes mine
i sometimes talk to him i mean
i don't know
we'll' see
mmhm
in the same building it's middle
but like right next to us is the elementary
and then there's like a preschool there
and then the high school is all the way near
not not wait
somewhere near the library
wherever that is
so
oh it's over there by the library
yeah the one next to f_i_u and the library
twelfth
eighth
yeah
hmm
yeah but it'll' be the same people
the only difference is that for elementary for elementary there are three different campuses the west campus east campus and f_s_u campus
east campus moves to central campus
middle at west
and f_s_u go together and move to west campus middle right
and then west
which is where you are
yeah
west campus middle and the east and east campus and no and central campus middle move together to
what's it called
the only high the big high the high the big high school
right
mmhm
but like i'll' still be with the same people
it's just like each time we keep adding more and more
so um what classes do you think you 're gon+ na take next year
next year i'm' taking algebra for math which is a ninth grade class
um i'm' taking let's see for language arts what am i taking
i think i'm' i'm' taking advanced language arts which is eighth grade class because advanced is a year advanced at my school
um i'm' taking advanced science probably
um i'm' not i don't have to take reading
because if i get a four or a five on the fcat um i don't have to take reading
because in seventh grade in eighth grade i mean you don't have to take reading right
and right there right here um right now i'm' taking seventh grade reading
so and next be taking eighth grade right
so and since in eighth grade i don't have to take anything i get an extra elective
so what are you gon+ na do
don't say p_e
why i'm' taking p_e
you don't even like it
you say it tires you too much
yeah i do
no i never said that
what other elective is there
um i'm' gon+ na take p_e and i don't know
what other elective is there
there's band which i'm' never gon+ na join
um art which everyone hates the teacher
spanish i speak spanish already
um
so you wouldn't take art class just because you don't like the teacher
do you even know the teacher
yeah
it's the same one for every elective
for every art elective
well i think you should take that class
yeah i might take art
or and p_e
i think art is better
because
i'll' take art and p_e
but if i if i could only pick one of them i'll' pick p_e
no
why don't why don't you want me to take p_e
because you said you didn't even like it
i never said that
i said uh
so does everybody have to take p_e or
no i i wan+ na take p_e
well how come um marissa took p_e
does she like it
no she she weighs like two tons
so you know what she did

um and she had that
and with the quarter p_e she had her first quarter she fainted
on the first day she fainted like five times

no she actually fainted
how can you faint five times
like not on the same day
but like the first day he put us to run for some reason like a lot
we had to run like two miles the first day
and we she she collapsed like she just collapsed was on the floor
i think twice in the same day both
she like collapsed a few times until she finally realized that she'll' get an f if she doesn't if she keeps on like fainting in the middle of class
uhuh
four seventeen
i go to work at five thirty today
hmm
i'm' gon+ na do q_a
yeah
didn't i already explain it to you
q_a means quality and assertion i think or accuracy
ok i don't need to know that part
yeah
what do you do in q_a
i have to
what do you have to do

hold on
what do you have to do
give me my phone thank you
ok fine
don't take my glasses
um i have to like put them the the food like on trays
mm thanks
what do you have
and like uh check them to see if they 're accurate how the people ordered it
and then send it to the tables
but have to do it like every ticket has to be under fifteen
and has to be cooked properly the way they want it with dressings they ask for it
so if it if it's like bad you get blamed for it
if the people didn't like how it was cooked or how it was made or if it was missing something they just send it back
and we'll' fix it for them
and meanwhile manager goes and talks to them
and tells them oh we'll' fix it for you
and like apologizes
and makes sure that the customer is satisfied
so yeah
hmm
that it it's way fun that togo
togo i don't wan+ na do togo anymore
why don't you get tips at togo
so i get i would get tips as server
i would get triple
what to get on a friday night
yeah i know
but you 'd also
yup yeah but you also get tips
um what's it called
ah at togo you don't got+ ta q_a
well i get paid more in q_a
so
you do
how much an hour
yeah
i get paid eight for togo
and i get paid ten for q_a
yeah but how much tips do you make in like a day in togo
like thirty five maybe
yeah thirty five and
if it's a good night
if it's a good night around thirty five dollars
yeah but you you make
but not always
it's not consistent
you make like ten dollars more in in togo per day right
huh
you you will make like ten dollars more a day in togo
maybe
but i don't always do q_a
i asked yesterday
i went in at four
but i had to work at six
so i didn't know
i thought it was at four o'clock
so i was two hours early
so i was like
you 're always like five minutes late
and and you and you go like two hours early
well i didn't know
i didn't know it was uh until six
how about checking the schedule
so yesterday i um did a starbucks run
i went to go get coffee for everybody
and then when i came back i started helping out one of the managers
and i was doing prep work which is like you know making the sauces and cooking the meat and cutting it up into pieces and stuff like that
isn't that what the what the chefs do
the cutting the
yeah
but managers do that too
so i started helping him
and then i started to ask him questions about how much they get paid and stuff
and he says they get paid like like a thousand like eleven hundred around there um every two weeks
so i mean for my age that's not bad
if i can get a manager position
yeah but you i don't really think
where are you gon+ na get a manager position
they could start training me
and then eventually just tell corporate that they 're training me
manager of what
togo general manager
well no
i mean if they really train me as manager i'm' probably not gon+ na stay at that store
because they 're always moving the managers to other to other restaurants
i mean to other stores of chili's
other chili's
other chili's yeah
they call them stores instead of restaurants
because they 're all restaurants
that's
but they 're different place
they 're they 're located different places
so they could move me which is not what i really want
but if they 're paying
ok well if if they 're paying i mean for that amount it doesn't sound bad to me
ok
so i mine as well take the opportunity if they offer
yeah but well like probably where would you get moved to
i don't know
it's not up to me or them
it's up to the corporate um place
so
what's the corporate place
it's like where they decide things about chili's like the stuff on the menu like uh
i don't know stuff they wan+ na change in each store
stuff like that
i don't know
yeah so i don't know
we'll' see
but or or i might actually quit chili's
yeah but where would you go to work
i was talking to your mom the other day
i might like look for a job at um
b_c_c
ah what's it called
yeah b_c_c
like there's this department called
the find what department
there's this department called something department of visual arts and something else
and uh i might see if they have anything over there
so we'll' see
i don't know
but you know
we'll' see
yeah i met get a job there or i was thinking maybe in the summer to work less or
why work less in the summer
because um
aren't you supposed to work more in the summer
no
i wan+ na work less because i wan+ na get into dance
i wan+ na do i wan+ na get into dance classes
i don't care what you think
it's not up to you
wait what type of dance classes
it's up to me
like ballet dancing that you stand on your toes and then your toes start bleeding
no like modern
like modern
good i'm' like
like hip-hopish popish
i don't know
something will come up
but i have to see
i think i get the other day i saw like there's a place in silver lakes
but i don't know
it looked like for young kids
so i don't know
i have to look for a place where where to go
but maybe we'll' see
yeah but it wouldn't be like every single day
it would probably be like twice a week
no it wouldn't
it would be like in the morning so
but but then i'm' gon+ na take two classes in the summer

*zeledon5.csv*
that's what they say
that's that's what colombia say
mmhm
ok
ok
hmm
mm
ok
no why
no but she's changing
why why you need it
that's is the letter that's is the sign you have
hmm yeah
i'm' working for este antonio lopez
mhmm
mmhm
ok
why
wow
exactly
that's the best thing to do it to deal with that
that's the way you do it here
i know
so that's the best way to go about it
you incorporate yourself as a person as your whole name
even though you have a w-two and you 're working for a like an employee
no no no that's in the case that you have a business
that's in case like if you have a business
and you 're taking tax write-off
yeah ok
like not w-two
she can do it
i don't know about her
if she wants
because in this year when we made the taxes for her she have a
she has to pay
she have a nine thousands
negative
nine thousands five hundred something
so good she doesn't have to pay
no that's good for for her para
she has lost a lot of equity
i was looking into the community where she bought
what does she have a three two or two two
three
three two
i don't i think she paid like three hundred thousand
and i think know if she's lucky
two forty
between two forty and two sixty
yeah i know
i know that
i know that
i'm'
i know it's bad
for her because she tried
sad
but i i give it to her the advise to waiting one more year to see what happens
she has to wait at least two more years
yeah but i don't i don't supposed to tell her that her husband
oh did you see the listing i sent you
yeah
miramar is too high
i see
is too high
i thinking maybe i don't know un poquito mas arriba
yeah but when you try to find out the the how much you are supposed to pay for the homeowners insurance insurance
yeah i know
do you know how much they pay just for the
they paying
assessment
they even they no paying
november two thousand six
how much
five thousand nine hundred
two ninety five two eighty eight every month
yeah but not only that
she had to pay attorney's fees
one thousand one hundred and fifty el abogado este
that's why
you cannot stop it
you cannot do it that
so
mmhm mmhm
mmhm
mmhm
no but a hundred and fifty is nothing
it's nothing compare to one thousand whatever
one thousand and something
yeah that's a lot of money
it happens
i hope things change
mmhm
email
mmhm
mmhm
go ahead
yeah
tell me
oh yeah yeah
in what category
which one
vacation
i wan+ na go to the caribbean or
but how plane
whatever whatever is a good deal
for all four of us it's the first time that we 're all going on vacation
well not the first time
no you are always on vacation with the kids please tell me
no no but i wan+ na take them to the caribbean because mariela is always telling me
she has this girl in school that is her same age
mmhm
and she tells me that um oh my friend aby that she tell she tells me that she's been on a cruise and i can't wait to go on a cruise and i always wanted to be in in a cruise and i can't wait to go on a cruise
wait wait wait wait back time you don't coming you don't go went with the babies before
on the cruise no not on the cruise
you left the baby here
yeah
oh
no last year we went to new york and i took them
yeah no but when i went i 've been gon+ na the caribbean
and into las vegas i went only with alberto
so i wan+ na take them this year
i was also waiting for the baby to be older
yeah that's the best time for him
which makes it easier for all of us
even though i don't think he's ready yet
but i'm' gon+ na take him now
you have to be watching him
he can jumping easily
yeah i know that's why i was thinking maybe maybe we can take like maybe like another
you know my brother's working in the caribbean
yeah he's working in the caribbean
he flies like every three weeks
he goes to costa rica
or he goes to mexico because he's you know he's a mortgage broker
what he's doing is he's doing loans but in the caribbean
ok
these properties are like one million and up
so when he stays there i can easily go
yeah
so i have to pay just the airfare
but why you don't try with spirit
they have good deals pero
eighteen thirty four
they have even nine dollars
but they catch you on the taxes
or they catch you on the on the way back
like they give you an eight dollar ticket to go there
and then
let's just say that the going tickets is eight dollars
and then the return is like a hundred and twenty plus two fifty in the taxes
three hundred and something
times four
no that's twelve hundred
that's too much
that's what i'm' saying
since you 're always on the internet if you see something you know reasonable
but you know you know what
i know june to to november on the hurricane season easily you can find less than two hundreds and fifty
not really because it's it's it's on vacation time
it's peak time
it's summer time
no but the problem is you have to buy six months before
and then you gon+ na catch the good deal
i 've been looking for something
because that's what
for a while
a with maria we 're talking about when there are coming next year
we 're gon+ na go to a a cruise
and we 're gon+ na try to buy it maybe on june or july
and we 're suppose to go on when they come in february two thousand nine with
i wish with my aunty
but i you know her
she is very scared with the cruise
really
yeah
why
she don't like it
she doesn't like it
i heard your mommy is coming next week
yeah on monday
i'm' gon+ na go with her to the home speed way
homestead speedway it's a racing
no no because we 're gon+ na the v_i_p
why you 're gon+ na take her there
it's for the company
the insurance company we have a big party there
and we 're gon+ na met everyone there
i 've been
i 've been i 've been there when it's cuando alberto trabajaba en coca cola
yeah what
carlos got a new job
telemundo
what are he's gon+ na do there
it's good for him
telemundo
oh
he is gon+ na be an employee for general electric
but he's gon+ na be working for msnbc
oh that's that's that is a big name
yeah
i like that
so he is a general general electric employee
telemundo
ah he like that
of course
of course
he's very happy
it's a good base salary
and you know they they give them up to twenty thousands dollars in bonus which is not bad
which one is the problem
the problem is that they don't give him a car
so he needs to get another car
yeah but he gon+ na more income right
yeah more income
but at the same time it's like it's another it's an extra expense that we have never had never
it's like having
the way i see it it's like oh my god they just throw us a baby in the house are you gon+ na take care of diapers formula because it's a insurance gas maintenance
everything
no matter what
where
infinity
she make a good deal
so
money money money
it's either money or credit and
the credit is not all that
because they offering him a big salary
and he decide to go with the money and no with the car
of course
sometimes you got+ ta give up certain things
yeah i know
yeah but that's
like all the jobs that he's had they they 're always giving him like you know company car
but now they 're not giving him a car but they 're giving him a good salary
so we'll' see what happens
but if you hear something good too you let me know
but i wish one you wan+ na find it
whatever you know just let me know
whatever you hear
whatever
i 've got a this week
it's impossible
because they 're gon+ na ask at the time they 're closing they need to see the original driver's license
he's suppose to go there
not only that because i can send a to his house
that's not the problem
the problem is that the person who is closing needs to see the i_d
he's a very good guy
it's a very good
i know
i feel bad for him
but unfortunately i can
i tried

*zeledon6.csv*
no but seriously there's a lot of mosquitos here all of a sudden
look at all the cigarettes
wow
ok so what else could we talk about
we should we we should keep a a steady conversation going on
work how was work today
you were working with me
i know but you are far away from me
yeah
ahah
because her shirt never covers her stomach brother
is so annoying
where you able to do the the job for jaime
what he was doing for you
yeah
yeah
what he had asked you to do
yeah but i need more
do you wan+ na move a little bit more back because maybe there's less mosquitoes
is that your teacher
oh yeah
do you
no i guess she was gon+ na meet up with another student
bye
ay let's go there
um
no but
because the reason that this is here is because of the grass
ok let's move a little bit
yeah
don't drop it
but why don't we sit in one of those things
because if we are around grass it's gon+ na be mosquitoes
but the
ok
look at the
it's another
mmhm
no this is
hmm
do you wan+ na see it
no
um
anyway
with anything
i think
her hair
turn let's just turn around
gives her back give her back
yeah
so we don't look like crazy people
so let's talk about something new
let's talk one let's talk one topic that we could talk about
emilio
emilio
emilio is a very
complicated
long complicated
there's mosquitoes everywhere
i'm' i'm' wondering if inside there's just mosquitoes like actually inside the building
yeah i know
but who cares
well i give it a break
let me see
maybe they just followed us over here
and now they are gon+ na leave
mosquitoes
ok
so
emilio
emilio is a very complicated person
i know
we could talk about something else
not not him
no
um
ok
peter
annie
but annie is what
uh annie today was talking to peter
but nothing
yeah
yeah
ok
i don't know how selena always always governs laura
she does
she wants yeah she went to selena
yeah so i called her
selena was eating right
and then she got out of the lunch
i don't know man
she i i don't like that lady
that lady like she is always like
she's too bossy
she's always bossing
oh you ok you wan+ na hear a story
ok
um before yesterday before yesterday iria gave me a job to do
mmhm
and then the next thing the next step that i had to do was um divide the patients by their case manager
mmhm
so there was there there was a stack of papers for clara
and there was a stack of patients for
selena
selena right
right
so and i go to selena
but the thing was that they were active patients right
so then active patients she wanted to follow them into their
so i um whether it was built or not built right
so then all the ones that i had finished were all built
and they were active
and they were all built
so then i went to selena
mmhm
and i didn't even write on the post-it the problem
iria wrote it with her handwriting
and it was simple
it was a simple simple problem
it was um one of them was to call the nurse and verify that there was a sharp container in the house
and the other one was um to call the nurse and verify that it was that his her son was still the house the caregiver caregiver or something like that
very simple
yeah that you could do it in five minutes
i understood what selena was telling me
but that's not my problem because i'm' just telling her what iria is telling me to do
and out of them all those ten two of them had problems
yeah like because it's TRUE
like if iria is telling you
iria told you revisa esto
exactly because there's a reason that they are the case managers so they could resolver los problemas
and not only that
like if she says she doesn't feel like doing it she doesn't feel like doing it
she is paying selena a a salary of a case manager so she could solve those problems
so the reason she's the case manager for the patient
right
i'm' not gon+ na bitch at her
oh yeah no you can't talk to her if you don't have patience
i'm' not gon+ na talk back to her
i'm' not gon+ na talk back to her
and i'm' not gon+ na bitch at her because there's just no point
so i go to her um
i looked at her
selena
all these mosquitoes
like she got it from my hand
and she goes
she put it to the side completely to the side
so this is gon+ na be this is gon+ na be later on whenever i have a chance
you 're good already
yeah
and then i gave her the other eight patients
and then i go to her
ah
and i'm' like
like i looked at her
you know her assistant
and then she just turned around
and she goes here pedro vea me esto
ay
you know to put it to the side
mmhm
so it was funny because that's the way selena reacted
but then i went to clara
clara had her own stack
and clara had one patient with one problem
and i go up to her
she goes ah ok eso es facilito
like she handled it with such patience
the thing is
i think she saw me
she saw the situation with selena
she saw how selena had reacted to it
so i think clara is being smart in the sense of like i'm' not gon+ na be a bitch
i'm' not gon+ na talk bad
of course
and not even that
i'm' i'm' not gon+ na handle
i'm' not gon+ na look
i'm' not gon+ na look
or like i'm' gon+ na handle the job with ease
do you get me
so she looks at me
and she like clapped her hand
and i just laughed
and she was like yeah bueno
um and here is the other
and then like today i had given her
i finished reviewing two more patients
and i gave her the rest
oh my god people keep calling my cell phone
hold on
pamela i'm' in school
bye
so then um
no
no i i don't know
she she picked up the phone
and she goes you have to call me
and i was like let me ask if it was an emergency
and then i gave her a
i gave her some things to do today to clara
like clara handled everything so perfectly and smooth
yeah but every time
if i give something if i
abigail is it an emergency
then what happened
and everytime i give clara something
she is the case manager for those patients
for those patients
that's what she has her salary for
that's what she's getting paid for so she needs to do her job
she like she does oh a little bit more work than than normal
she already like she gets at she is i don't know she's she's learned to not be as rude
but she's pretty rude
i get she likes things her way
yeah she's very rude
she has to learn how to treat people because like everybody everybody after i hear selena scream they come out through through the
did you see what happened today in the morning
ah
ok
you remember in the morning when you and me were sitting in the front
remember that lady
oh yeah
yeah the law lady
she went in
and then like five minutes i went in also because i had to give something to rosa to
so i went in
and i gave something to whatever
and they were talking
but they were talking kind of loud
and then like two minutes later i go back into for a fax
and maria and were at it
like they are screaming at each other
so marta and maria have been at it
martin and maria have been at it
everybody has been at it with maria because she just doesn't know how to handle situations
including me when that time when that time that she
she's rude
she's rude
i think she's very rude
i think she just never learned people skills
people skills
yeah because when somebody cuando
exactly
it's about no matter how mad you are you hold in your anger
and you have some sort of modales
do you get me
your coworkers
screaming at people
exactly before before before you scream you could just talk
and it's not that
remember when annie was her asistente
but do you think these people
everything's
er
um
maybe they are studying or something
who cares
do you wan+ na move somewhere else
there are some mosquitoes here
no mosquitoes
oh you you wan+ na go to
oh no because the teacher said that she had to see us to come in and see
but my class is right there
and there's nobody in the class
no
let's go in the class then
um
i think she's not in the class
yeah
that maria was screaming every five seconds
to to to annie
do you get me
of course
yeah
but it's not even
it's beyond that
it's beyond the fact that like
look in this way
it's beyond the fact that like it's like
it doesn't matter if i'm' twenty years old or if i'm' or if or if i'm' thirty or forty
exactly like you have to learn it because
you just
they 're they 're your coworkers
they 're not a kid
i mean they 're your coworkers
from nine to five that person is your coworker
and it's not even that
they are not your they are not anything
honestly
er um but there's a lot of mosquitoes outside
i know like we 're getting bitten
no but um but i thought i thought you weren't in here
that's why we were like let's just go back
oh
oh ok
no no no
i feel bad
i feel weird talking
oh ok ok ok
thank you
yeah
yeah
uhuh so what were what were we saying
she she always
she always screams
and it's just like you have to learn how to talk to people
and you have to learn how to defend yourself as well
because if i was in marie's shoes i would look at her
i feel bad now
whatever
if i was in marie's shoes i would look at her and be like maria tu crees que tu me puedas hablar a mi como una persona por favor
because they are a persona
exactly
like the one time that maria has
you can sit here
you 've never heard maria scream at me
so she's like
ah
ah oh yeah she does that all the time
so she was like ay
yeah and then she was like no no no no no no
and i'm' like maria
you got bit with a lot of mosquitoes
i know
uhuh
i looked at her
and i was like maria
no no no no
you told her that
yeah
what did she say to you
no that she was just like
i know
i'm' allergic to mosquitoes
um
and then that's it
and you 've never ever ever heard maria screaming
maria had a problem with everyone at work
you know you 're dressed in black
black attracts more mosquitoes
black attracts mosquitoes
go for your shirt
i know
but i'm' wearing jeans
you are black
i know i have one here now
i have one everywhere see
in cuba it was really bad
when i used to live in cuba when i was a little girl
mmhm
everything is with the windows open
and then all mosquitoes come in
yeah
in your bedroom
yeah
did that get hot

unless unless you open a window
and you let more mosquitoes come in
but you still get air
not really

yeah that's what it is
thank you
yeah because may

and then august
august is when when fall term starts
so i have june and july
pretty much how january
the same you are gon+ na be walking with kind of
yeah you'll' be you'll' be fine
no
i'm' not gon+ na be willing because i have my operation in in january
january
and by late february i was walking fine
mmhm
do you get me
yeah
so
yeah that's the same thing
you are gon+ na have june and july to
plus school doesn't start like the first week of august
i have a little bit of august
no it's just kind of late august
yeah you have a little bit of august
yeah
to be able to completely
i can't wait man
i wan+ na wear high heels
i know
but i think you should off for the high heels
neat boots fast cheap end of all
everyone's boots dot com
possibly yeah
yeah that could just be any
how much does a term in f_i_u cost you
how many classes do you take
about
exactly if we are gon+ na take all four classes it'll' cost about a thousand and
i think it was six hundred more or less
ok it's a hundred dollars per credit
a hundred dollars per credit
and then each class is more or less worth three credits
like english is worth three credits
and math is worth three credits
do you get me
yeah
but um like let's say that semester that i took it the the freshmans arrived or whatever
that wasn't worth
that was only worth one credit
do you get me
so let's say you are taking four classes
um so four times three each one being three credits that's twelve credits
times about a hundred that's about a hundred a thousand two hundred mas o menos
and then you have to then pay all the fees
the parking fee the fee
i don't have that fee yet
yeah
i don't have that fee
and then it comes out to like i guess a little less like a thousand five hundred or something
well for me it's a thousand flat
everything for five classes was a thousand flat
and that's five classes
um wow
that's what i paid last year
it's a thousand flat
wow that's good
nine hundred and ninety nine dollars and like seventy six cents or something like that
it's good
yeah
the f_i_u
i paid that out of my pocket
i had a i had a savings account
i paid for my for my miami-dade term half of my car
and that's it
yeah
and then my mom paid the other half of the car
and that's it
and my dad didn't help with squat
that's not good
um
that's how it is
but i was gon+ na tell you the the thing here er ok
i think so
yeah and here it's just a hundred
well
so it's about thirty
times twelve how much is that
but that's what i'm' saying
i don't know i just came straight over here
i'm' gon+ na do my i'm' gon+ na
finish
practically like saving money
it is saving money
just came straight over here
carlos was here and
i like the school
oh that's TRUE
that's TRUE
i'm' gon+ na have to come to this school
he he guided me through it
the school
no you get the hang of it
i know i'll' get the hang of it because when i first saw miami-dade i was oh my god this is so confusing
ah you see miami-dade seems too confusing to me
not confusing
but it's seemed like a jail to me
jail
yeah
no
because it's just the buildings
this class is ugly compared to the classes i had in miami-dade
the buildings are too like gray
only outside
this is this is just this is a small class though to be honest
english classes are put in a really small class
most of our
all my other classes i ever had even my math class which is right in this building but towards the other end they 're all big classes like auditorium like
even if it's just for a hundred students
but they 're the type that you walk in
and they have like steps
you get me
that you go up and then
that's how all my classes are
the only classes that have been really small always have been my english classes
all the other ones are like those types
so the reason i like miami-dade es porque
i just don't like how the building looks
f_i_u have a lot of arts
and like the buildings look prettier and like
huh i don't look at it
and and miami-dade has like
but it gives you more environment
miami-dade has like arts stuff too
oh it's one of those
it's one of those where where ever you need to go
yeah it's building four
exactly
and then you just find the room inside
well it's building four like let's say four two zero five
it's building four second floor fifth room
yeah
yeah exactly
that's the way it's split up
em that's easy
building three and parking here
and in between each building parking there's a little parking in cases there's not space
and
i always find space close to my class
parking
no parking is very very difficult
extremely difficult honestly
you have to be here about
like i'm' really used to this
i really know like i just go into the garage
and i go to the fifth floor because there's always gon+ na be parking there
but it's pretty difficult
and takes before like freshman freshman year but the first semester i ever took here i never had such a hard time parking
but that's because i wasn't like
and i would get there way early
like i'll' be at school like an hour half an hour before my class
and it's just like i didn't know to early
just don't bother looking for parking right
fifth floor
can use the elevator
no no no for me is leaving in like lo que tenia que esperar era cinco minutos
and somebody left
somebody always left
and all i have to do
no
and then the buildings here they 're just
they 're not by numbers
but they 're by names
they 're like this this building here is the chemistry and physics
ah i know
but when you when you 've
this is a chemistry and physics building with an an english class inside of it
yeah
yeah
cause they 're using it as an english class you know
this is obviously a lot of other things

*zeledon7.csv*
that's your mom's opinion
and your dad's opinon
and i'm' my my my parents's opinion
it changes
don't you think
yours not mine
well my dad yeah big time

you
there's time for everything

and how long have we been talking for
i 've no idea
actually six minutes
oh god
yeah
so we have another like thirty five minutes to go

he doesn't
no she didn't
mick invited us not not fiona
mick did
mick did not not
well started an hour ago
we we went from one thing to another
aw
no i er saw trishia today and she said oh i haven't seen you
i said yeah i haven't been here in a long time because i was outside you know they were doing that
oh the the garage yeah
like a flea market thing like a garage sale or something toys and stuff
uhuh
yeah exactly
and i said to her
you know what i i really like it
trishia's the owner
tsk oh ok yeah
we recently met
and she said hey i'll' give you a good
good deal
it's twenty five dollars a month
well they had a better deal then that
why
because when when i when i signed up it was hundred and sixteen for the whole year
i know
no no it's three hundred and something
yeah
that's why
or i'm' gon+ na talk to her
or just just tell her yeah
yeah i'm' gon+ na say hey give me because i was there for so long and then
yeah
and and everybody else signed up for that deal
that that i don't like because it's not
how how often do they do that like twice a year right
because sometimes at home i get those bills for you know for ted
i don't know because porque um
yeah because er the contract is let's say x amount of money
uhuh
one sixty let's say
sixty nine i think it was
no er whatever
so
um yeah
yeah but in anyway it's a good deal
it is half of
i know
they have too many people
that they can't no dan abasto
so the machines are always occupied
busy um
yeah
and the classes are always full
really
which isn't cool in some
um
and i think the the the quality of the classes improve
yes because before they were kinda like empty
yeah
and then they didn't have enough people teaching
and now and the the instructors improve too
really
because they didn't have good people before
yeah
i i scheduled to stay for two classes because i normally can do that y hmm chica que oh
i hate aerobics
i love sculpting
that's my favourite thing
but it's like step
i hate aerobics
the the first half is step aerobics
and then it's a
who's giving that class
marian
ok
but they 're gon+ na build another building
right they 're gon+ na do another building
what are they doing
what i'm' i it's
because they 're gon+ na
what are they doing i don't know
they were gon+ na well
last time i i heard they were they sold all that property
yeah everything they
and they are gon+ na build the hilton
an upscale hilton or or the marriott yeah
marriott
um
one of those that's gon+ na happen
but on the left or where the gym is
tsk everywhere because they are gon+ na do a hotel and time-share property time-share apartments
but that's good for us isn't it
yeah it is good for us
it is good for us
part of the hotel
not
inside of the hotel
it will be most likely
sean we are recording here
aw don't be mean
aw ok the gym is gon+ na be inside like
it's not gon+ na be like right now just the gym and the spa
yeah because what they are doing
yeah what they 're doing trying to do is a resort a complete resort with the golf course and the spa
but they 're gon+ na be the same owners like trishia and dan
tsk no so
no they didn't they are not renewing the contract
i i heard from someone else that the owner pat segal the seegal the owner he is not renewing them the contract for next year
seegal
so be careful to what you sign
aw it's TRUE
because maybe
so where are they gon+ na go
i don't know
but after a day deep down i don't understand how that works
well i think that they run the building
they 're renting that
i don't know
who knows
i i was under the understanding that they rent that from pat seegal
tsk is it
i don't know
probably just the property probably
and then that's why they can take that thing down and
and the
i don't remember
but i remember there was
so i don't think that
gridiron gridiron
uhuh
ok
that is not bad for them
because she looks older
oh my god
because he looks like owner
are
are you sure
uhuh
they they walk sometimes on the
have you seen them
yeah that's her father
they look just alike
but they he doesn't look that he's that much older to be her father
